       "[{'abstract': 'The etiologic and pathophysiologic findings described in the first part of this paper have important consequences: The recognition of the specific etiology of diarrhea requires new laboratory methods: most of these, however, are technically easy to perform and do not require a large laboratory. A long-ranging consequence of this changed concept is a well-founded modification of therapy. The most important discovery was, that in a well balanced glucose electrolyte solution sodium and glucose enhance their absorption mutually and increase the absorption of water by solvent drag. Since in most acute diarrheas the mechanisms of absorption of glucose and electrolytes are retained this mechanism can be utilized for fast oral rehydration and reinstitution of normal intestinal homeostasis. Prompt institution of a diet consisting of the previously mentioned glucose-electrolyte solution usually prevents severe dehydration and the need for stationary treatment. The elimination of lactose and long chain fatty acids from the diet prevents continuation of the pathologic osmotic and chemical conditions in the intestine. Antibiotics are not indicated in acute diarrhea with the exception of diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive E. Coli or Shigella, in the case of Salmonella-gastroenteritis even contraindicated. Further research concentrates on the development of drugs for neutralisation of E. Coli enterotoxin and the prevention of diarrheas by development of effective vaccines.',\n",

During three years in a busy infertility clinic, specifically designated for cases of functional infertility, 491 patients were seen and 96 per cent of them kept valid basal temperature charts. The use of the BTC enabled therapy to be instituted early on in the course of investigations in those cases of infertility in which there was an endocrine factor. There were 420 patients in this category; of those who received treatment a high percentage became pregnant in contrast to those who were being observed. It is recommended that the BTC should be used early and more frequently in the management of cases of infertility, since it has been shown to serve as an inexpensive and convenient parameter of ovarian function.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Sperm agglutinating antibodies are purified from sera and cervical mucus of women with unexplained causes of infertility which were positive in the FD-test. Fractionation was performed by affinity-chromatography in a batch device and the sperm agglutinating activity controlled by the Franklin and Dukes test. This sperm antibody fraction was determined via crossed immunoelectrophoresis by migration into an anti-human serum containing gel. In all cases only one big peak resulted. The negative control serum and mucus samples demonstrated no precipitation peaks. By absorption studies it was shown that the sperm agglutinating antibodies in sera were IgM and in cervical mucus IgA. The concentration of IgA and IgM was determined by comparison with standard human IgA and IgM. Thus only one serum- and one cervical mucus antibody seems to be responsible for agglutination. The number of experiments, however, is still too small for general conclusions. This method is easily and quickly performed and can therefore be used as a routine method for the determination of sperm agglutinating antibodies. Its application for sperm-immobilizing or cytotoxic activity remains to be tested.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The effect of copper and plastic intrauterine devices (IUD) on the fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium was studied in the rat. A copper or a plastic device was placed in one of the uterine horns, while the other horn served as a control. Biopsy specimens were obtained from both horns and examined histochemically. The copper concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The fibrinolytic activity of the control horn was found to be localized to small vessels in the outer layer of the uterine wall, while that of the endometrium was low. Plastic as well as copper IUDs increased the fibrinolytic activity which, in contrast with what was seen in the controls, was localized to the endometrium. Compared with the effect of the plastic device, the increase in the fibrinolytic activity induced by the copper device was more widespread in the endometrial area and was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of copper. These findings might help to explain why the contraceptive effect of IUDs is more reliable when they are partly coated with copper.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Contradictory views have been expressed about the role of the various antisperm antibodies which develop after vasoligation. The present study was conducted in 50 normal fertile males, 50 vasectomized subjects and 25 subjects after recanalization of their vas deferens in order to investigate the development of various anti-sperm antibodies after vasectomy, along with their incidence, their persistence after successful relief of vaso-obstruction by vasovasostomy and their role in the causation of infertility in vasoanatomized normospermia males. Sperm agglutinating, immobilizing and haemagglutinating antibodies showed rises in titres with increase during the post-vasectomy period, indicating continuous antigenic stimulus. Age, post-operative complications and blood group did not seem to alter the results. 86% of subjects developed antisperm agglutinins, mostly tail-to-tail type (54.5%), 1-12 years after vasoligation, while only 2% of fertile men had circulating spermagglutinins. A lower incidence of positive sperm in the immobilization test than in the agglutination test suggests either that different antibodies are detected by these two tests or these tests have differing sensitivities. Of the 25 vasovasostomized subject, 13 (52%) cases became normospermic and 4 (16%) oligospermic while 8 (32%) remained azoospermics. Except for 3 oligospermic subjects, all had circulating spermagglutinins. Among the 13 normospermic vasovasostomized persons, a significant correlation was found between the titres of circulating antisperm agglutinins and autoagglutination of spermatozoa in their ejaculates; and also between the sperm immobilization values of their sera and the degree of their sperm motility. Three normospermic recanalized men, having low levels of sperm agglutinins and haemagglutinins with normal seminogram and no sperm immobilizing antibody, successfully impregnated their wives. Another 10 vasovasotomized infertile subjects had sperm agglutinins in significant titre; 5 showed positive sperm immobilization values, a similar number showed autoagglutination of sperm, while a decreased degree of motility of sperms was noted in 6 cases. Thus there was a significant correlation between the titres of anti-sperm antibodies and autoagglutination of spermatozoa, which might be an important cause of male infertility after successful anatomic relief of vasoobstruction. Histological studies of testicular biopsy showed normal spermatogenesis in azoospermic recanalized subjects, although they had high levels of antisperm antibodies. This suggests that these antibodies do not affect normal spermatogenesis, and sperm counts.',\n",

The control group was given ketamine alone. The dosage of ketamine was 2 mg/kg body weight, supplemented if necessary by 1 mg/kg, in combination with either 2 mg flunitrazepam or placebo. No other anaesthetics were used. On several counts, the combination of ketamine and flunitrazepam was proved to reduce the adverse reactions seen with ketamine alone. Motor restlessness and confusion in the awakening state occurred with significantly less severity and frequency. Amnesia for dreams was significantly more frequent. Memory of dreams was often unpleasant after ketamine alone. The influence on pulse rate was significantly smaller and no significant changes in systolic blood pressure were seen, whereas a significant increase occurred with ketamine alone. Less pronounced fluctuations in diastolic blood pressure occurred with the combination ketamine-flunitrazepam. Respiratory rate increased significantly with both treatments, but respiratory minute volume was lower with the ketamine-flunitrazepam combination.',\n",

       " {'abstract': '(1) In order to study the relationship between aromatization (estrogen biosynthesis) and 1beta-hydroxylation, the effects of a variety of factors on these processes were evaluated. (2) Using the C18 substrate, 4-estrene-3,17-dione, it was found that carbon monoxide, SU-4885, amphenone B, potassium cyanide, 4-androstene-3,17-dione and 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione inhibited the above transformations significantly and to varying degrees. However, within a given experiment the inhibition of each process was similar. (3) SKF-525A did not inhibit either transformation. In addition, phosphate, Tris and barbital buffers, as well as pH changes from 6.9 to 7.7, had no stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the production of estrogen and 1beta-hydroxy compounds. (4) In contrast, several inhibitors affected the aromatization of C19 and C18 steroids differently. These include carbon monoxide, SU-4885 and amphenone B. (5) When a mixture of 4-[7beta-3Hi1estrene-3,17-dione and 19-[4-14C]nortestosterone were incubated together the former was preferentially converted to estrogen. This preference for the 17-keto steroidal form mimics results observed for C19 substrates. (6) We conclude that while estrogen biosynthesis and 1beta-hydroxylation appear to be mediated by the same enzyme system, the same conclusion cannot be drawn for the aromatization of C19 and C18 substrates.',\n",

Cross sections of the testes were prepared for histological examination and the nuclei of the various types of germinal cells were enumerated at stage VII of spermatogenesis.

The investigations reveal that each of these conditions of impaired fertility is characterized of a special type of Sertoli cell. The cell pattern is either restricted to one or two of the normally occurring cell types, or modified cells predominate that might be typical of the underlying disturbances of spermatogenesis. It is suggested that the cell type which prevails in the Sertoli-cell only syndrome is capable of maintaining a basic production of a substance that inhibits FSH secretion.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione, which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme 17-ketosteroid reductase. Evidence is presented which suggests that there are two distinct 17-ketosteroid reductases in rat testes, one in interstitial tissue and one in seminiferous tubules. The two enzymes have different pH optima, 5.6 for the one from interstitial tissue and 6.5 for the one from seminiferous tubules. At the optimum pH, a 70-fold difference in Km values was observed, 17 muM for the interstitial tissue enzyme and 0.25 muM for the enzyme from seminiferous tubules. Testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects of each of these enzyme activities. The interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several 5alpha-reduced metabolites of testosterone and by estrogens. The most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol, followed by 17beta-estradiol approximately equal to dihydrotestosterone greater than testosterone greater than estrone greater than estriol. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol and 17beta-estradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 2.2 and 3.7 muM, respectively. In contrast, it was demonstrated that among the above steroids, only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor. Testosterone stimulated the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from seminiferous tubules, while it had no effect at high concentrations. The remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. The difference in response of the two enzyme activities suggests a mechanism for local regulation of testosterone synthesis in each testicular compartment that does not involve directly pituitary gonadotropins.',\n",

This report compares the prolactin binding to tumor membranes in two mammary tumor strains derived from MTW9. Maximum binding to membranes of both tumors occurred at pH 7.6 after incubation for 30 hr at 4 degrees. The binding was inhibited only by polypeptide hormones that possess lactogenic activity. MTW9-P, an ovariectomy-responsive tumor developed in rats maintained on daily perphenazine injections, had 4-fold-higher prolactin binding than had MTW9MtT, an ovariectomy-nonresponsive tumor developed in rats bearing the mammosomatotropic pituitary tumor, MtTW10. Withdrawal of perphenazine from rats bearing MTW9-P caused a fall to normal of plasma prolactin, no tumor regression, and no significant change in prolactin binding. In contrast, resection of MtT resulted in tumor regression, a fall to normal of serum prolactin, and a nearly 3-fold increase in prolactin binding. Scatchard plots of prolactin binding data yield an apparent affinity constant, Ka, of 1.2 X 109 liters/mole for both tumors. The 4-fold-higher prolactin binding in the ovariectomy responsive variant suggests a positive correlation between ovariectomy response and the number of membrane prolactin-binding sites. No correlation between prolactin sensitivity and prolacting binding is apparent.',\n",

These 35 couples had been infertile for at least 1 year prior to surgery. Seventy-seven per cent had been trying to conceive for more than 18 months. Following diagnostic evaluation, periadnexal adhesions were found to be the sole cause of infertility in 83% of cases. Subsequent to surgery, 63% of the patients conceived, 82% within 18 months, and 57% gave birth to at least one viable child. There can be no doubt that periadnexal adhesions represent true pathology. Although often seemingly insignificant in character, at the macroscopic level, they appear to play a major role at the microscopic level in impairing ovum pickup by the fallopian tube. Gynecologists should recognize the importance of these structures as mediators of a condition of relative sterility. Thus, despite the demonstration of tubal patency, the function of the rather delicate fimbria may be compromised by periadnexal adhesions, conglutinations, and hydatids so that only a fraction of those eggs that leave the ovary at ovulation reach the interior of the fallopian tube.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The LH FSH estradiol and progesterone responses to acute stimulation with LH-RH were studied in 12 normal women with ovulatory cycles (4 in the initial follicular phase, 4 in the mid-follicular phase and 4 in the late follicular phase) and in two castrated women, two under hormonal contraception, two with ovarian amenorrhea, twelve with central amenorrhea of no detectable origin (6 with normal and 6 with low basal gonadotrophins), eleven anovulatory patients with pseudomenstruation, two with anorexia nervosa, and two with pituitary amenorrhea. Each woman received a rapid i.v. injection of 100 microgram synthetic LH-RH at 9:00 a.m. Serum levels of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone were determined by radioimmunoassay in samples collected before and 60, 120, 240 and 480 minutes after injection. The findings were : 1) A significant rise in estradiol and progesterone levels, in addition to LH and FSH elevation, in normal women; 2) A lack of ovarian steroid response in the castrated women and in ovarian amenorrheas, which suggests that the source of steroid response to stimulation is not extragonadal; 3) Significant differences in the responses of the four hormones to LH-RH in the women with central amenorrhea in comparison with the normal group with great variability of results; the steroid response in the presence of a positive LH response might correlate with the severity and/or prognosis of the disorder, a point deserving further study; 4) In anovulatory women with pseudomenstruation, LH responses for the most part normal, and particularly, progesterone responses.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"As in women receiving oestrogens the administration of 17beta-oestradiol to ovariectomized female rats caused a rise in fasting plasma triglycerides and a fall in plasma glucose. Progesterone, on the other hand, had no significant effects. In the oestradiol treated rats, the portal vein basal insulin levels were slightly reduced. Oestradiol, however, had a marked suppressive effect on the alpha cells of the pancreas resulting in a greater reduction in basal glucagon and impaired glucagon response to alanine infusions. The relative insulin to glucagon (I/G) molar concentration ratio in portal vein blood was increased. Oestradiol also produced a dose dependent increase in the activity of the liver lipogenic enzymes, acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. On the other hand, the activity of the gluconeogenic rate limiting enzyme phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was inhibited. The cross-over pattern of gluconeogenic intermediates confirmed inhibition of gluconeogenesis at this step, an effect which is similar to that induced by relative insulin 'excess'. Progesterone produced an increase in the portal vein insulin concentrations. Both the basal and the alanine-stimulated glucagon levels were also increased. The I/G molar ratio in portal vein blood of progesterone treated rats remained unaltered and the hepatic lipogenic and gluconeogenic enzyme activities were similar to control animals. These data suggest that insulin activity is increased relative to glucagon in the liver of oestradiol-treated rats due to the rise in portal vein I/G ratio. The changes in liver lipogenic and gluconeogenic enzymes and the alterations in fasting plasma triglycerides and glucose in response to oestrogens could be secondary to this effect.\",\n",

Ninety-nine of the patients were also examined for agglutinating and immunofluorescent antibodies to sperm to see if there was any relationship between the occurrence of anti-sperm antibodies and other autoantibodies. However, the prevalence of non-sperm autoantibodies did not differ in two nearly equal groups of patients with and without indications of autoimmune reactions to spermatozoa, respectively.

The corresponding recovery rates for patients with psychogenic amenorrhea and amenorrhea following self-induced weight loss were 72% for both groups, and in patients with the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome and idiophatic functional amenorrhea the recovery rates at 6 years were 64 and 61% respectively. Unlike the other groups with functional amenorrhea, patients with the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome had impaired ovarian responsiveness to exogenous gonadotropins. Bromocriptine treatment resulted in disappearance of the galactorrhea and restoration of the menses and/or ovulation in nine of 18 patients; of these three became pregnant. The effect of bromocriptine did not persist for long after treatment ceased, and permanent recovery was recorded only in four patients. The group with functional amenorrhea included 34 patients who wished to become pregnant. Gonadotropin treatment was successful in 20 patients, clomiphene-hCG in two, tamoxifen in two, bromocriptine in two, and combined bromocriptine and clomiphene in one. Thus, the overall pregnancy rate in patients with functional amenorrhea was 79%. The groups with ovarian amenorrhea inclutients with assumed ovarian failure responded to large doses of exogenous gonadotropins by ovulation and three became pregnant. Ovarian wedge resection was ineffective in all five cases with polycystic ovaries, but two patients became pregnant after treatment with clomiphene and chorionic gonadotropin, and one with exogenous gonadotropins.',\n",

The reason for this has been assumed to be a direct interaction of the hormones in the respiratory center. A shortly published paper dealing with 50 women under long-term treatment with a combination of oestrogenes and gestagenes for oral contraception leads the author to the assumption, that a metabolic acidosis is the primary reaction, followed by an increase in breathing activity for respiratory compensation. In a long-term study it is difficult to differentiate between primary and secondary effects. Therefore in the present experiments arterial blood has been analyzed for PaO2, PaCO2, pH and hemoglobin in 49 subjects on day 1 without hormone administration and on day 2 prior to (9.00 a.m.) after (11.00 a.m., 1.00 p.m., 4.00 p.m.) administration of a combination of oestrogene and gestagene. From the measured values O2-saturation, standard-bicarbonate, buffer bases and base excess have been calculated by the Thews nomogram. By comparison of the results before and after hormone administration it was shown, that the primary effect is a metabolic acidosis, partly compensated during the next 7 h by respiratory adaptation. There is no indication for a primary respiratory alkalosis.',\n",

The intrauterine potential as measured with either metal or nonpolarizable salt electrodes is positive at the fundal with respect to the cervical end of the uterus. Placement of dissimilar metal electrodes within the uterus will induce voltage gradients that are roughly predictable from their cell potential in blood as an electrolyte. When copper and zinc electrodes are placed at opposite ends of the uterus, they induce voltage gradients that are typically greater than 100 mv per cm. External copper and zinc wires connected at one end, and with the other ends in contact with various positions on the skin of rats, were found to influence potential gradients within the uterus. When a length of zinc wire was wound around the upper portion of the stem of a small Cu-7 200 IUD, it took about 1 year from insertion for the zinc to disappear. When the zinc wire was wound around the lower portion of the stem, it disappeared in 1 month. The zinc reduced intrauterine corrosion of the copper and it was more effective at reducing copper corrosion when in the lower stem position.',\n",

Six cases of similar age and obstetric history with normal menstrual cycles served as control. Pelvic angiography revealed widespread vascular occlusion of myometrial arteries, in seven of the twelve cases. These findings account for the small amount of endometrium removed on diagnostic curettage in these cases as well as the greatly reduced menstrual loss. The poor obstetric history of the cases studied may well be due to this excessive vascular damage.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The etiology of primary dysmenorrhea, which is the most common gynecologic complaint and cause of lost working hours, remains obscure but merits careful scientific investigation. Recent studies suggest that increased endometrial prostaglandin production and release may be responsible for dysmenorrhea. Prostaglandins cause myometrial contractility that, if excessive, leads to uterine ischemia and pain. This hypothesis has led to clinical trials of antiprostaglandin agents such as indomethacin and fenamates, which inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin through the prostaglandin synthetase system as well as antagonize their action at the cell receptor level. The good response of dysmenorrhea to other conventional forms of therapy such as oral contraceptives and dilatation of the cervix can be partly explained on the basis of a reduced level of prostaglandins in the menstrual fluid with such therapy. There is a definite need for further evaluation of the antiprostaglandin compounds in the treatment of dysmenorrhea so that sound formulations can be evolved for the elimination of this incapacitating disorder.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Forty-two percent of collagen sponges tested as an intravaginal barrier contraceptive method developed malodor when retained for 5 days. Only 4% developed odor when the sponge was removed within 24 hours after intercourse, rinsed, and reinserted. While sexually active volunteers found odor in 37% of the sponges, odor formed only in 4% of the sponges worn by sexually inactive users. No difference in the rate of odor formation was found when neutral pH (7.0) and acid pH (3.4) collagen sponges were tested, although we believe that a pH 3.4 is too acid and promotes odor formation. The optimal pH of the sponge should be 4.5 to 5.5. Malodor was efficiently extracted from sponges by washing in acid milieu of tap water and vinegar or 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Alkali extraction procedures were ineffective, and lukewarm water was slightly less effective than acid extraction of odor. At the time of malodor development, the high content of polyamines (putrescine, spermine, spermidine) in the ejaculate decreased to undetectable values. We conclude that the ejaculate is the major source of malodor formation in intravaginally worn collagen sponges. Removal, rinsing optimally in vinegar solution, and reinsertion within 24 hours after intercourse reduces the chance of malodor formation.',\n",

The procedure makes use of the initial 50-fold purification effected by their precipitation whith ammonium sulphate, with simultaneous elimination of most urinary corticosteroids and 50--60% of urinary ketosteroids. It also employs the antioxident ascorbic acid as an additive in most stages of the procedure. The mild organic-solvent-HIO partition system of Brown is used for separating the strongly polar, 2including all \"labile\" estrogens, and of the weakly polar estrogens, from neutral steroids. The remaining neutral steroid still interfering with the assays were removed by an ascorbic acid treated ion exchange resin (AG 1). The final residues were revealed by mass-spectroscopy to consist almost solely of estrogens. Gas-liquid chromatography in which just 2 chromatograms are required yields a total of 12 \"estrogen\" peaks (for 12 estrogens which are excreted in amounts greater than 0.1 mg/day) in normal pregnancy urine, including all the known labile estrogens. Identification as estrogen for all but a few minor peaks of the gas chromatogram was obtained by mass-spectroscopy. The practical significance of the method lies in the fact that some labile estrogens are much more important in the estrogen metabolism of pregnant and nonpregnant women than heretofore generally thought.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Indirect immunofluorescent, macroagglutination and immobilizing sperm antibody estimations were performed as part of a prospective study on a representative group of 63 infertile couples. Serum from both, cervical mucus and seminal plasma were tested and the clinical use of the tests evaluated by considering the pregnancies that occurred and the causes of infertility that were discovered in the subsequent year. The indirect immunofluorescent test had the largest number of positives although more were found in seminal plasma than elsewhere. In these, both male and cervical factors were implicated and in this media there were less positives pregnant with the acrosome and midpiece patterns absent. The macroagglutination test had no positives pregnant and again more significance was attached to positives in the male. Similarly, immobilization results showed most positives in seminal plasma where the male and cervical factors featured prominently. It would, therefore, appear that if any clinical use is to be derived from the three tests in the search for antisperm antibodies as a cause of infertility, testing the male and especially seminal plasma appears to correlate best. If treatment is to be recommended, therefore, it should be concentrated on the man.',\n",

For this reason research into greater-than-average life expectancy and longevity is only possible on an interdisciplinary basis. Many theories of longevity despite convincing arguments also have their weak points. Critical analysis of the theories available to date reveals that longevity rests on an optimal combination of two major factors: 1. on a genetic predisposition in people with longevity in the family--this is the case in most instances. 2. on additional exogenous factors of a social, psychological, ecological and medical kind.',\n",

Rifampicin caused a significant reduction in the A.U.C. of a single dose of 1 mg norethisterone from 37.8 +/- 13.1 to 21.9 +/- 5.9 ng/ml X h (p less than 0.01). The plasma norethisterone half life (beta-phase) was also reduced from 6.2 +/- 1.7 to 3.2 +/- 1.0 h (p less than 0.0025). In one additional woman on long term oral contraceptive therapy the 12 hour plasma norethisterone concentration was reduced by rifampicin from 12.3 ng/ml to 2.3 ng/ml. Rifampicin caused a significant increase in antipyrine clearance, 6 beta-hydroxycortisol excretion and plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity but there was no significant correlations between changes in these indices of liver microsomal enzyme induction. There was a significant correlation between the percentage increase in antipyrine clearance and the percentage decrease in norethisterone A.U.C. during rifampicin. The changes in norethisterone pharmacokinetics during rifampicin therapy are compatible with the known enzyme inducing effect of rifampicin.',\n",

Histamine was found to augment the implantation response to suboptimal doses of estradiol in the ovariectomized pregnant rat maintained with Depo-Provera. The effect of histamine was found to involve both H1- and H2-receptors and to be inhibited by treatment with a combination of mepyramine and metiamide. Treatment with this combination of histamine antagonists during early pregnancy in the intact rat did not modify blastocyst attachment. It was concluded that the effect of histamine on the implantation response to exogenous estradiol was due to increased uterine blood flow and/or estrogen uptake but that such histamine-mediated effects were not essential for blastocyst attachment during normal pregnancy.',\n",

Their review, unfortunately, is marred by numerous errors which vitiate the potency estimates. The actions of progestagens in target organs depend upon the specific binding of the compounds to a protein receptor that is produced by estrogen treatment. Potency of hormones depends ultimately upon this binding. Since it seems unlikely that specific binding occurs in such nontarget sites as the blood vessels, direct potency relationships are highly improbable between diverse phenomena. Possible relationships between oral contraceptives and specific side effects must be studied in relationship to individual side effects and particular contraceptive products. Possible coincidental activities, no matter how analyzed, are unlikely to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of these drugs.',\n",

The response was reversed by the SRS antagonist FPL 55712. On the basis of isotope incorporation experiments, spectroscopy, and chemical degradations, the SRS was identified as a cysteine-containing derivative of 5-hydroxy-7,9,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid. This amino acid was attached in thioether linkage at C-6. The SRS is structurally related to previously identified epoxy and dihydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid in leukocytes. A common feature is the presence of a conjugated triene, and the name \"leukotriene\" has been introduced to designate these compounds. Leukotriene A (5,6-epoxy-7,9,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid) is an intermediate in the formation of leukotriene B (5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid) and is proposed to be a precursor also of leukotriene C, which is the SRS identified here.',\n",

A testicular biopsy was performed at the time of operation and a number were investigated for cell-mediated immunity to sperm and for the presence of circulating sperm-agglutinating and cytotoxic antibodies. The first 17 cases have been studied and of these there have been 11 pregnancies, ten of which have already come to term with the birth of normal infants, including one set of twins. Of the rest, two are known to have oligozoospermia and four have been lost to follow-up, although two of them were euspermic when last examined. In spite of these encouraging results, it is considered that there are no grounds for alterning the present basis of vasectomy counseling which is that the operation is likely to be irreversible.',\n",

Possible changes in the causes of mortality are examined for three periods of time (1954-1961, 1962-1971 and 1972-1976). The overall incidence was 3.6/10 000, changing through the three periods from 4.9 to 4.3 and finally to 3.0/10 000. Vascular accidents were the cause of death in almost one third of the cases, emerging as the most important etiologic factor. Older age and higher parity did not seem to influence the incidence of obstetric deaths. Cesarean section was involved in ten of 23 cases in which the death was directly related to the pregnancy and delivery. In six patients there was a rupture of the uterus. The number of preventable deaths has decreased steady, but research into the problem of vascular accidents and dampening of the enthusiasm for cesarean sections may further improve the situation.',\n",

Indomethacin enhanced significantly the Isometric Developed Tension (I.D.T.) of the isthmic but not the ampullar region. On the other hand, a single and identical concentration (10(-6) M) of PGE1 and PGI2 depressed the ampulla whereas PGE2 and PGF2-alpha enhanced its contractions. In the isthmus, PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2-alpha augmented whereas PGI2 diminished the I.D.T. Dose-response curves of PGI2 demonstrated a dose-dependent depression of I.D.T. and contractile frequency of both ampullar and isthmic regions. Furthermore, in the isthmus PGI2 resulted in a biphasic action on resting basal tone (depressing at low and augmenting at high concentrations), whereas in the ampulla only a progressive dose-dependent decline, was observed. The results suggest that a prostaglandin with inhibitory capacity, presumably PGI2, may be synthesized by the human isthmus and play some role in the reduced spontaneous activity observed under estrogenic dominance.',\n",

Seminal plasma was separated within 2 hours of ejaculation, and prolactin was measured in duplicate by radioimmunoassay. The difference between the prevasectomy (mean +/- SEM 11.1 +/- 0.8 ng/ml) and postvasectomy seminal i prolactin (mean +/- 9.9 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) was statistically significant (mean +/- SEM 1.21 +/- 0.53 ng/ml, paired t-test, t = 2.36, P < 0.05). The mean prevasectomy seminal prolactin correlated with the corresponding mean postvasectomy value of the same subject (linear regression analyses, r = 0.77, P < 0.001). This study suggested that the accessory sex organs were the major source of seminal immunoreactive prolactin, and that a minor contribution might come from the in vivo presence of spermatozoa and/or testicular secretions.

       " {'abstract': 'The study was undertaken to determine whether aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced liver tumors in rats produced alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) and whether the age of the animals would influence such as appearance, a finding suggested by data seen in man. Other liver carcinogens (N-hydroxy-N-2-fluorenylacetamide, N-2-fluorenylacetamide, and diethylnitrosamine) were tested for their ability to induce liver tumors producing AFP. The presence of AFP. The presence of AFP in the serum was determined by double diffusion in agarose and by comparison also by quantitative radioimmunoassay. Using double diffusion, AFP was detected in the majority of tumor-bearing rats that had received either N-2-fluorenylacetamide or N-hydroxy-N-2-fluorenylacetamide. Sera of diethylinitrosamine-treated rats with liver tumors were all positive, whereas sera of rats bearing AFB1-induced tumors were positive in only a few cases. However, all sera of tumor-bearing rats examined had elevated AFP levels by radioimmunoassay. Nonetheless, the average level of AFP in the sera of rats bearing AFB1-induced tumors was considerably lower, compared to the sera of rats with tumors caused by diethylnitrosamine, N-2-fluorenylacetamide, or N-hydroxy-N2-fluorenylacetamide. Rats started on AFB1 when 6 weeks old had more mixed liver tumors with neoplastic hepatocytes and bile ducts and higher AFP levels than did rats started at 26 weeks of age. However, the histological grade of differentiation of inducted tumors did not seem to influence the AFP level.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Sperm survival, in terms of numbers, motility, viability, and metabolic activity, was studied in vaginal washings obtained daily from 22 healthy, fertile, married women during one complete menstrual cycle. The numbers of sperm (counted on Papanicolaou-stained filters) were never large compared to the number of sperm in a single ejaculate. Forty-eight hours after intercourse, only 6% of the specimens showed any evidence of sperm. Motile sperm were observed in only six of 94 postcoital specimens examined within 12 hours after intercourse. Lack of sperm in specimens collected after reported intercourse was associated with contraceptive practices other than the rhythm method, which most of the subjects were using. Fluorochromatic studies of recovered sperm treated with acridine orange indicated sperm viability and phase contrast studies of sperm treated with tetrazolium salts revealed metabolic activity. Our data on sperm motility, numbers, and staining reactions support the conclusion that the small number of sperm that remain in the vagina after intercourse quickly become inactivated.',\n",

T mycoplasmas were isolated from 63% of these couples, and Mycoplasma hominis from 18%, compared with 56% and 13%, respectively, in those who did not conceive. 88, with primary infertility of unascertained cause, took part in a controlled trial with doxycycline. The couples in the trial were allocated randomly to three groups: 30 received doxycycline, 28 received a placebo, and 30 couples were untreated. Although a twenty-eight-day course of doxycycline eradicated M. hominis and T-strain mycoplasmas from 27 (96%) of the 28 couples harbouring them, the rate of conception was no higher in those treated with the drug than in control groups. It is  concluded that mycoplasmas are not associated with primary infertility and that, although doxycycline eradicates them, this drug is of no benefit in the treatment of primary infertility of unascertained cause.',\n",

This study was undertaken to see if prostaglandin F2alpha would oppose the effect of the lactogen on the prostate as it does the luteotrophic action of the hormone on the corpus luteum. When it was found instead that the PGF increases steroid binding and that its interaction with lactogen was neither antagonistic nor additive, attention was directed to further characterization of prostaglandin's effect. A dosage/response study of F2alpha alone showed that concentrations of 4 ng/ml and 40 ng/ml increased binding but that 400 ng/ml did not. Glands with stromal hyperplasia and/or inflammation were not responsive than those with epithelial hyperplasia. Assays of water extracts of the tissue revealed concentrations of about 340 ng of F2alpha per gram fresh weight and that the concentration varied inversely as the beta-glucuronidase activity. If the enzyme level is considered an index of the epithelial cell density within the specimen, the inverse relationship suggest a non-epithelial (stromal) site of prostaglandin concentration.\",\n",

In each case, the effect of chlormadinone was evaluated in relation to hormonal levels and seizures observed during a control period and under the effect of placebo as follows: Control (PC)-Chlormadinone acetate (PCL1)-Placebo (PP)-Chlormadinone acetate (PCL2). In a male child (4MS), the number of convulsive attacks observed in the control period (26/month) was reduced during PCL1 (2/month) increased during PP (12/month) and was reduced again during PCL2 (0/month). Spike EEG density showed a parallel course to the clinical attacks. In this case, control levels of testosterone were markedly elevated (40 ng/ml) and were decreased during PCL1 to 4.0 increased again during PP to 34.0 and decreased again during PCL2 to 1.2 ng/ml. Plasma levels of pituitary gonadotropins were unchanged throughout the entire period of study. In other cases, neither the number of epileptic attacks nor spike EEG density were apparently affected by this regime and plasma levels of pituitary gonadotropins and gonadal hormones were also unmodified. These results suggest that a latent state of hyperandrogenism may be detected in some epileptic patients with intractable seizures and that chlormadinone may reduce convulsive attacks in these patients, probably by decreasing testosterone plasma levels.',\n",

A few elevated levels (up to 30 nanounits/ml) were detected in some normal individuals, especially in the older age-groups. In addition, there was a systematic age-dependency of AFP levels particularly evident in the groups from Singapore-Lyon, in which there was a 50% AFP increase between the ages of 20 and 40. Comparison between Africans on the one hand and people from Singapore-Lyon on the other hand revealed highly significant differences (p less than 0.001), especially in the younger groups, whereas Chinese, Malays, and Indians from Singapore had very similar AFP pattern; this suggests an important role for environmental factors in the regulation of AFP levels. The age dependency of the presumed effect of environmental factors is in keeping with experimental data showing that young animals respond more vigorously to AFP-stimulating factors. Although the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differs in the three Singapore groups (the highest in Chinese and the lowest in Indians), no relationship was observed in this study between mean AFP level and HCC incidence in Singapore.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The prenatal diagnosis of anencephaly and spina bifida (neural tube defect, NTD) through amniotic fluid analysis for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is gradually gaining clinical recognition. AFP concentrations were determined in 237 amniotic fluids from normal pregnancies ranging between 7 and 42 weeks of gestation. A steady decline in AFP from 26 mug/ml at 7-9 weeks to 155 ng/ml at term is observed. AFP concentration was determined in 35 amniotic fluids from 33 confirmed neural tube defective pregnancies. In 14 cases where amniotic fluid was examined prior to the 26th week of gestation. AFP was markedly elevated when compared with the normal range of the same gestational period. In 21 amniotic fluids past the 26th week, 17 cases (85-) had markedly elevated AFP levels; however, 2 cases of anencephaly, 1 of spina bifida, and 1 of hydrocephaly gave levels within the normal range. It is concluded that elevated AFP in the amniotic fluid is a reliable but nonspecific marker for open neural tube defects prior to the 26th week of pregnancy, but may become normal after the 26th week in a small percentage of patients.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'A formulation containing 95% delmadinone acetate was compressed at three different pressures. These pressures resulted in a pellet density difference of 19%. In vivo dissolution profiles were determined for five lots of pellets. The pellets were implanted subcutaneously in rats, removed periodically, and assayed chemically for remaining steroid. The resulting data were fit, using the computer program NONLIN, to a dissolution model. The dissolution rate for the lot with the lowest density made at the lowest compression was statistically (p less than 0.05) different from the four other lots. A possible explanation for this increased dissolution rate could be that channeling occurs within the pellet, thereby increasing the effective dissolving surface. The results also indicate that equivalent dissolution rates between lots are reached at a certain compression and density.',\n",

Elevated amounts of serum level of pregnancy associated alpha2-globulin could be detected in 37 of the 40 women taking Bisecurin and in all 20 taking Infecundin. Cervicundin however, failed to induce any change in the serum protein pattern of the 10 subjects studied. Serum levels of pregnancy-associated alpha2-globulin were higher in the Infecundin-taking (53 mg %), than in the Bisecurin-taking group (29 mg %).

The data presented demonstrate that by means of hormone measurements, basally or after stimulation tests, the exact level of the lesion can usually be determined. This allows a decision with regard to appropriate therapy to be made on the basis of an accurate diagnosis. In many instances basal measurements of pituitary and gonadal hormones are all that is required to decide the level of the lesion. Care in interpreting basal levels is required, however, in view of methodological limitations and of known physiological variations with age, time of day and hour-to-hour fluctuations. If the basal hormone levels are borderline, or if the 'reserve function' of part or all of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis needs to be assessed, than the appropriate stimulation test should be performed. The indication for these stimulation procedures and results obtained in different conditions are described and problems of interpretation discussed.\",\n",

The fact that their diagnosis or prognosis was not revealed to them allowed many patients to maintain the hope either that they might not have cancer or that the outlook might be favourable.',\n",

The serum protein pattern was determined by the paper electrophoretic method. A significant decrease of the aminotransferase GPT was viable during the sequential therapy with ethinyl-estradiol and norethisterone acetate.

The constant infusion technique yielded values for the conversation ratios for the transformation of delta5-diol to several products: dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)/delta5-diol of 0.06+/-0.01 for men and 0.05 +/- 0.01 for women, of delta5-diol sulfate/delta5-diol of 0.45 +/- 0.04 for men and 0.52 +/- 0.03 for women and of DHEA sulfate/delta5-diol of 5.53 +/- 0.26 for men and 5.02 +/- 0.42 for women. The single injection technique yielded rate constants (units) and volumes of distribution (liters) for delta5-diol; Ki = 34.3 +/- 4.3 for men and 35.0 +/- 3.9 for women, K2 = 63.7 +/- 4.1 for men and 75.1 +/- 4.2 for women, V1 = 23.1 +/- 3.2 for men and 11.9 +/- 2.3 for women, V2 = 14.8 +/- 3.7 for men and 9.2 +/- 3.2 for women.

       " {'abstract': 'In male and female rats the endogenous steroid and gonadotrophin secretion was inhibited by injecting high doses of chlormadinone acetate (CmAc) from day 14 to 24 of life, i. e. during the period of brain maturation. In adulthood the males treated prepubertally with CmAc exhibited reduced sexual activity and fertility, whereas the females did not differ from the controls. More complete sex hormone deficiency during brain maturation was achieved by castration on day 14 of life. Controls were castrated at normal puberty time (40--60 days). Both groups were then substituted with androgens or oestrogens. In the females castrated on day 14 no impairment of sexual behaviour was observed as compared to the later castrated controls. In contrast, the early castrated males showed delayed onset of mounting behaviour. At autopsy, the weights of their sex organs were found to be lower than in the controls despite equal testosterone replacement for several months. These findings speak in favour of a permanently diminished responsiveness to androgens in males having been exposed to more or less severe androgen deficiency during sex specific brain maturation. Hence, the maturation of a male hypothalamus as well as the differentiation appears to depend at least in part on the presence of androgens, whereas in females it runs without hormonal influence.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was induced in female rats by administration of progesterone in late pregnacy. This prevented parturition, with intrauterine fetal death 2 to 4 days past term and subsequent retention of dead fetuses. Concomitantly with or closely following the intrauterine death of their litters, a large proportion of pregnant rats died with histologically evident DIC. Administration of cortisone, heparin, or disoumarin did not prevent DIC, and xi-aminocaproic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, or an onion-rich diet tended to increase its incidence. Antibiotic regimens gave variable results, with significant decrease in DIC only with a combination of two wide-spectrum penicillins. Neomycin and polymyxin had little effect on susceptible Sprague-dawley derived rats, but polymxin caused a significant increase in DIC in a resistant strain of hooded rats. Fatal maternal DIC was completely prevented only by use of natural or synthetic estrogens concurrently with progesterone, although this did not alter the sequence of abnormally prolonged pregnacy with intrauterine fetal death and retention of dead fetuses. Potencies of estrogens varied greatly, but all compounds tested prevented DIC at adequate dosage levels. Diethylstilbestrol, the most potent drug tested, was completely protective at 1 mug daily given subcutaneously. beta-Estradiol was the most effective natural estrogen, giving complete protection with a 10-mug daily subcutaneous injection. Estrogens were much more potent by subcutaneous injection than by oral ingestion, and toxic side effects were sometimes noted with higher levels of the latter. For estrogen therapy to be effective, it was necessary to begin its use before the expected onset of DIC, and in no instance was there evidence of reversal of this process after signs of illness were observed.',\n",

With the help of this highly sensitive radoimmunoassay the early effects of both androgen and estrogen treatments on the hepatic synthesis of alpha2mu globulin in the rat have been investigated. 2. Results show that the earlier observation of the long lag period in the androgenic induction of alpha2mu globulin is more apparent than real. 3. Single injections of either 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone(5alpha-dihydro-17beta-hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one) or its physiological antagonist estradiol-17beta (1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17beta-idol) to castrated female rats resulted in the induction of alphamu globulin reaching maximum hepatic level of the protein between 6--9 h after the hormone administration. Administration of cycloheximide 15 prior to hormone treatment blocked both androgenic andestrogenic induction of alpha2mu globulin. 4. Daily pretreatments with 5alphamu-dihydrotestosterone increased the sensitivity of subsequent androgenic response to alpha2muglobulin synthesis. On the other hand, daily pretreatments with estradiol 17beta decreased and ultimately abolished the estrogenic induction of alpha2mu globulin. 5. The possible mechanism of both androgenic and estrogenic induction of alpha2mu globulin in rat liver mediated through a sex-hormone-binding protein with dual affinity for both dihydrotestosterone and estradiol has been suggested.',\n",

It is concluded that the elevated E2 level was responsible for suppression of gonadotropins which, in turn, caused mild hypogonadism and sterility in this patient. According to the stimulation tests, the source of the elevated E2 levels was testicular.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The relationship between spontaneous abortion and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels was investigated between 9 and 25 weeks of pregnancy. Seven out of 126 (5-6 per cent) women who had spontaneous abortions had raised maternal serum AFP levels at their antenatal booking visit compared to 4 out of 247 (1-6 per cent) control patients who were delivered of single liveborn infants, a statistically significant differences. The raised AFP concentrations were, however, associated with spontaneous abortion only if the serum samples had been taken immediately before, or at sometime after the abortion was first clinically suspected. This suggests that high levels do not predict the development of abortion in women who have not already threatened to abort. It is therefore unlikely that women who have not already threatened to abort. Therefore, when maternal serum AFP levels are used to screen for fetal neural tube defects, women referred for a diagnostic amniocentesis on account of a high level are unlikely to have been selected on the basis of a tendency to abort.',\n",

Spinnbarkeit and ferning were also assessed, and the basal body temperature was measured and recorded during these cycles. The profiles were synchronized according to the LH peak. The midcycle period, characterized by the rapid increase and decline of estrogen and the beginning rise of progesterone, shows a prounced minimum of immunoglobulins, C'3, proteinase inhibitors, albumin, and lysozyme in cervical mucus, which is known to be most receptive to sperm penetration at this time. Although the variation of cervical mucus values is considerable during the early proliferative and the luteal phases, the midcycle values appear to be constantly low, showing slight differences among the profiles of the different parameters. The statistical evaluation and the assessment of the significance of parameters for ovulation detection and the assessment of the fertile period as well as the correlation of these parameters with basal body temperature will be the subject of the second communication of this series.\",\n",

The major findings included cystic endometrial hyperplasia and pyometra requiring hysterectomies and alopecia for the norethindrone-ethynylestradiol and dimethisterone-ethynylestradiol treated dogs. These groups did not have accentuated mammary development or treatment-related hyperplastic or neoplastic changes. For dogs given dimethisterone-ethynylestradiol, numerous acne-like lesions occurred in the skin of the mammary areas. Dogs given the higher dose levels of megestrol acetate had marked mammary stimulation, hyperplastic and neoplastic changes in the mammary glands, and clinical and pathologic changes typical of diabetes mellitus. Mammary changes of nodular hyperplasia, benign mixed tumor, and adenocarcinoma appeared as distinct entities although constant and intense mammary stimulation may be a common denominator. Such mammary changes have not been found in long-term studies in monkeys or rats with megestrol acetate, and the relevance of the canine mammary changes to projecting potential tumorigenesis in women is questioned.',\n",

Preliminary evaluation of the film took place with five sample groups: high school students, university students, nursing students, health educators, and Planned Parenthood workers. Survey results indicate that the film is relevant for each of these groups. Pre and posttest measures of the attitudes of the university and nursing samples indicate that the film makes viewers more aware of the psychological factors involved in the non-use of birth control.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The prophylactic effect of low-dose heparin on postoperative fatal and on clinically apparent but non-fatal thromboembolic complications was studied in a double-blind, prospective, randomised study comprising 1296 patients. 16 out of 653 patients in the placebo group had such complications within the treatment period of 1 week, compared with 4 out of 643 in the heparin group. This difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). 4 cases in the placebo group and 1 in the heparin group were fatal. After prophylactic treatment had been stopped at the end of the first postoperative week, the rate of thromboembolic complications was equal for the 2 groups. Low-dose heparin prophylaxis is thus effective and should be given routinely in patients aged over 40 years; it should also be given for more than 1 week in patients not ambulant by then.',\n",

Statistically similar correlations link social class with the incidence of venereal disease and the incidence of in-situ carcinoma of the cervix, both of which are epidemiological variables in squamous cervical cancer.

Illness incidence rates for production workers (64%) were significantly higher than for nonproduction personnel (16%). The mean blood Kepone level for workers with illness was 2.53 ppm and for those without disease 0.60 ppm (p less than 0.001). Blood Kepone levels in current workers (mean, 3.12 ppm) were higher than those in former employees (1.22 ppm). Blood Kepone levels for workers in nearby businesses and for residents of a community within 1.6 km of the plant ranged from undetectable to 32.5 ppb. Illness attributable to Kepone was found in two wives of Kepone workers; there was no apparent association between frequency of symptoms and proximity to the plant in the survey of the community population.',\n",

The purpose of the present investigation was to study the occurrence of psychic and sexual effects in women taking either Ovosiston (mestranol 0,08 mg + chlormadinone acetate 2, 0 mg) or Non-Ovlon (ethinylestradiol 0,05 mg + norethisterone acetate 1,0 mg). 186 somatically healthy women were subject to two interviews, immediately before the start of therapy and six months after it. Most of the patients recorded distinctly alterations of their mood, their initiative, their elemental desires such as appetite, sleep, need of warmth, and their sexual behaviour. 73 of them noted a change in their emotional pattern, which was positive in 34 and negative in 39 cases. 99 women reported changes in their elemental desires. 136 patients exhibited alterations of their sexual behaviour, which were assessed as an improvement or impairment in 108 and 28 cases, respectively. There is a statistically significant correlation between the impairment of sexual function and the incidence of other untoward side effects. On the other hand, negative suggestion by poor experience of other women on by the influence of mass media seems to play a minor role in producing changes of sexual behaviour. There is, however, a clearcut relationship between negative suggestion and the incidence of unfavourable emotional alterations. The findings are discussed with reference to their clinical significance.',\n",

In the 32 hours after treatment there was an overall reduction in stool output of 66 +/- 5% in the chlorpromazine-treated patients. This decrease was significantly larger than the 26 +/- 9% reduction in stool output seen in patients not receiving the drug, who were observed at the same time in the course of their illness.

       " {'abstract': 'The monoclonal anti-ethinyl-estradiol antibody previously found in the serum of a woman on oral contraceptives, was precipitated by 25% saturated ammonium sulfate à 22 degrees C. This simple test has been used to investigate the possible relationship between abnormally precipitating gamma-globulins (GAP) and the vascular risk of the pill. Four groups of women were studied: --50 women who had never used the pill; --100 women on oral contraceptives; --30 women who had stopped the pill; --17 women had experienced venous or arterial thrombosis during oral contraception. The results obtained indicate: 1) that a GAP increase is nearly always associated with the thrombotic events (90% of the cases in group 4); 2) that the presence of GAP is seen only in part of the women population on oral contraceptives representing approximately 30% of the total population investigated as indicated by a bimodal distribution. 3) that the GAP remain increased for months and even years after the pill was discontineud. The significance of this test is discussed. It is proposed that the presence of GAP in the serum appears to be related to the presence of ethinyl-estradiol binding antibodies. This hypothesis is verified by experiments in progress.',\n",

The risk decreased with increasing numbers of live births, with increasing numbers of incomplete pregnancies, and with the use of oral contraceptives. These three factors can be amalgamated into a single index of protection--\"protected time\"--by considering them all as periods of anovulation. The complement of protected time--viz., \"ovulatory age\", the period between menarche and diagnosis of ovarian cancer (or cessation of menses) minus \"protected time\"--was strongly related to risk of ovarian cancer. Other factors found to be associated with increased ovarian cancer risk were obesity, cervical polyps, and gallbladder disease.

       " {'abstract': 'To explore the possibility that the wide variation in bone loss among oophorectomised women might be due to differences in adrenal androgens or their biosynthetic pathways, 18 women (10 with very fast and 8 with very slow bone loss) were selected. Serum levels of nine adrenal steroids, including the major androgens and cortisol, were measured under basal conditions and after overnight suppression followed by acute corticotropin stimulation. In addition, basal serum oestrone, oestradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, sex-hormone-binding-globulin, corticosteroid binding globulin, and urinary free cortisol were measured. The only significant differences found were that women who lost bone rapidly had significantly higher urinary free-cortisol excretion (p less than 0.001) and a paradoxically diminished cortisol response to corticotropin. These data make it unlikely that endogenous adrenal androgens or oestrogens are a major factor in preventing bone loss after cessation of ovarian function; cortisol by its catabolic effect, however, may be a significant factor in causing osteoporosis.',\n",

There was no relationship between PR concentrations and the plasma steroid levels when the 2 phases of the cycle were considered; however, a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.70;  P less than 0.005) was observed between PR concentration and plasma 17 beta-estradiol when only the follicular phase was considered. PR was then measured in the endometrium of 14 postmenopausal patients treated with ethinylestradiol at increasing doses with or without association of chlormadinone acetate. Ethinylestradiol was shown to increase PR concentration (P less than 0.05), and chlormadinone acetate was found to prevent this increase. These data suggest that in humans, as in other mammalian species, the endometrial PR concentration is under estrogen and progestin control.',\n",

Progesterone, hCG and hPL levels fell more rapidly than 17 alpha-OH progesterone levels. This might suggest that the main site of synthesis of 17 alpha-OH progesterone is probably in the corpus luteum of pregnancy or that the prolonged half-life of hCG maintains the corpus luteum to secrete longer. Human placental lactogen fell dramatically within 4 h but the hCG level was maintained. This difference probably reflects only the differences in half-lives of these hormones.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'A pituitary stimulation test with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was undertaken to determine (1) whether pituitary responses to GnRH vary in individual women taking oral contraceptive steroids over time, (2) whether a less suppressive pituitary gonadotropin effect is produced by formulations containing less than 50 microgram of estrogen, and (3) to obtain more information concerning prolactin secretion in users of oral contraceptive steroids. The same subjects who had had a suppressed luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) response 6 to 9 months previously also had a suppressed response, indicating that this effect persists over time. Contraceptive formulations containing less than 50 microgram of estrogen have a lesser suppressive effect on LH release than do formulations containing 50 microgram of estrogen or more. The basal prolactin (PRL) response as well as the maximal PRL response to TRH were found to be significantly greater in subjects using oral contraceptives than in the control subjects. However, no difference in PRL response was found between the subjects using low or high doses of estrogen fomulations.',\n",

Carbohydrate tolerance was evaluated by oral glucose tolerance testing in the human subjects and by intravenous glucose tolerance testing in the baboons and beagles. In the human subjects, neither mestranol nor ethynylestradiol at daily doses of 50 to 100 microgram/day produced any effect on fasting glucose levels or on glucose tolerance even after six cycles of treatment. The addition of the progestational compounds also had no effect on these two variables. In baboons, ethynylestradiol and mestranol were bioequivalent and produced a dose-related decrease in the glucose disposal rate. All three progestational agents counteracted this effect in a comparable manner. In beagles, on the other hand, estrogens produced an increase in the glucose disposal rate, and the addition of progestational agents produced an initial fall and a subsequent return to pretreatment levels.',\n",

The first case, a young woman who, after several years, of cyclic consumption of 4 mg of norethylsterone acetate and 0.05 mg of ethynilestradiol, died from a transtentorial temporal hernia due to severe intracranial hypertension. Angiography, and later autopsy, showed thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses and also of the majority of the emissary veins with C.S.F. blockage. The second case, a patient who took 1 mg of norethyndrone and 0.05 mg of mestranol for 20 months, developed a focal symptomatology (Grand Mal, global aphasia without lowering of the level of conscionsness) which cleared up rapidly. The CAT performed during the clinical illness showed mild signs of intracranial hypertension while cerebral angiography normal. It seems possible that the hormonal treatment may disturb the mechanisms of C.S.F. production-reabsorbtion and the filtration dynamics of the blood-brain barrier and perhaps, cause alteration of hypothalamic-hypophysial function. This would explain a transitory symptomatology, such as benign intracranial hypertension. However, the thrombosis of the venous sinuses (sometimes, as in our first case, massive) may be due to the venous stasis, that accompanies intracranial hypertension and to the altered blood coagulation.',\n",

Contraceptive doses of synthetic progestins cause a moderate increase or no change in glucose-stimulated insulin production, depending on route of administration and species tested. Estrogens potentiate the insulinotropic effects of progesterone and the synthetic progestins. Basal serum triglyceride concentrations are generally unaffected by progesterone or 17 alpha-acetoxyprogesterone treatment but may decrease during 19-nortestosterone administration. Glucose tolerance does not change during treatment with gestamimetic doses of progesterone alone but may improve in rats and monkeys during concurrent estrogen administration. By contrast, deterioration of glucose tolerance is observed in women treated concurrently with synthetic estrogen plus 19-nortestosterone derivatives and, occasionally, with 19-nortestosterone derivatives alone. No consistent changes in glucose metabolism have been observed after treatment with 17 alpha-acetoxyprogesterone derivatives alone. The cause of the species-related differences in glucose metabolism during 19-nortestosterone treatment is obscure.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"Infections pose a nutritional stress on the growing child. No therapeutic goal is as important as the rapid recovery of preillness weight after acute infections. Successful convalescence, with supernormal growth rates, can be achieved with relatively brief periods of intensive refeeding, offsetting any tendency toward reduced immune defenses or other nutritionally determined susceptibilities to further infection. Since the mother is the only person who can effectively manage convalescent care, she must be given specific tasks with measurable targets in order to reliably oversee the child's rehabilitation. Not generally considered in the realm of preventive medicine, effective home-based convalencent care is the first crucial step in preventing the next round of illness. An approach to the widespread mobilization of mothers to monitor and sustain their children's growth is proposed in this paper. Rather than a passive recipient of health services, the mother becomes the basic health worker, providing diagnostic and therapeutic primary care for her child. Only the mother can break the malnutrition-infection cycle.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The incidence of coronary heart diseases in France is estimated from three sources of information. Mortality statistics underestimate the number of deaths from coronary heart diseases. An evaluation of this number is proposed, but with a rather important lack of precision; for example, between 10 and 20% of male mortality between age 45 and 64. These French coronary death rates are inferior to those of numerous other European or Anglo-Saxon countries, but are comparable with those of some mediterranean countries. The incidence of coronary heart diseases measured in the Paris Prospective Study is inferior by half to that of the Framingham Study and is also inferior to those of several male populations from the 7 Countries Study, in the same age limits. Three French registers give similar results about the incidence of acute myocardial infarction. This incidence is equal to the lower limit of those measured in 21 foreign registers. These concording data suggest that the incidence of coronary heart diseases is relatively moderate in France. Etiological hypotheses are planned and the interest in a surveillance of French sanitary data is reminded.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Daily administration of estrogen antagonists to premenopausal women has been incorporated into the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. We have studied the changes in reproductive hormones, pituitary responses to hypothalamic-releasing hormones, and endometrial histology during treatment with the antiestrogen tamoxifen in five healthy, premenopausal women. These studies were carried out during one menstrual cycle before and during two cycles of antiestrogen treatment. All subjects continued to have regular menses with biphasic basal body temperature records. During treatment, estradiol (E2) levels were increased but followed the usual pattern reflecting follicular maturation and corpus luteum formation. The mean E2 concentration at the midcycle peak and during the luteal phase was twice that observed during the non-treatment cycle. By contrast, the concentrations and secretory patterns of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were not greatly changed, and the gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone were not suppressed. Endometrial biopsies obtained during the follicular phase of control and tamoxifen treatment cycles showed no differences whereas biopsies obtained during the luteal phase of tamoxifen cycles uniformly showed a lack of changes attributed to progesterone action with no progression of histologic changes beyond those expected on day 7-8 of the luteal phase. These observations are consistent with maturation of multiple ovarian follicles, a surprising finding considering the normal gonadotropin concentrations. The retarded development of the endometrium in the presence of supranormal serum E2 and progesterone concentrations is a morphologic demonstration of the antiprogestational effect of antiestrogens. The lack of gonadotropin suppression in the presence of hyperestrogenemia suggests a major antiestrogen action on the hypothalmus and pituitary gland.',\n",

The prototype system consists of microcapsules made of the biodegradable polymer d, l-polylactic acid, in which micronized crystals of NET are homogeneously dispersed. NET is slowly released from the microcapsules following intramuscular injection at a rate of 0.90 microgram NET/day/mg of microcapsule by diffusion of the steroid from the polymer matrix. Three different doses of a standard preparation of microcapsules were tested in normally cycling female babbons (4 to 5 baboons/group). Following injection of either 300, 200, or 100 mg of microcapsules containing 75, 50, or 25 mg of NET, blood samples were collected at selected intervals and analyzed for NET, estrogen, and progesterone by radioimmunoassay. All three doses provided continuous NET release for 6 months following injection. The NET serum profiles for the different doses are parallel, and ovulation was inhibited in all baboons for 6 months following treatment.',\n",

In four of the six subjects the menstrual-like pains were associated with bleeding. No comparable effects were observed in the control group. Peroral administration of Zoapatle decocts did not produce any cardiovascular changes, and it did not influence the hematologic status, liver, kidney, and thyroid function, blood lipids, proteins, and electrolyte status. Under the experimental conditions used, Zoapatle extracts did not induce a luteolytic effect judged from the plasma progesterone (and estradiol) levels. It is concluded that peroral administration of freshly prepared decocts of Zoapatle in early pregnancy exerts a distinct uterotonic effect and induces cervical dilatation and uterine bleeding. These changes are not associated with any effect on the plasma levels of progesterone and estradiol or with any untoward side effects.',\n",

With these priorities in mind a program of selective primary health care is compared with other approaches and suggested as the most cost-effective form of medical intervention in the least developed countries. A flexible program delivered by either fixed or mobile units might include measles and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination, treatment for febrile malaria and oral rehydration for diarrhea in children, and tetanus toxoid and encouragement of breast feeding in mothers. Other interventions might be added on the basis of regional needs and new developments. For major diseases for which control measures are inadequate, research is an inexpensive approach on the basis of cost per infected person per year.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'In a further evaluation of the use of oral thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in puerperally lactating women, a radioimmunoassay for its measurement has been developed. Its concentration in plasma as well as that of prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) were measured following either intravenous or oral administration of TRH. Basal concentrations of TRH in 14 normally cycling women ranged from less than 5 to 17 pg/ml. Two luteal phase studies produced peaks in plasma TRH 5 to 10 minutes after 100 micrograms of TRH administered intravenously with a return to basal concentrations within 2 to 3 hours. In 10 normally menstruating women, ingestion of 10 mg of TRH orally resulted in plasma TRH which peaked at 423 +/- 123 pg/ml (standard error of the mean) at 30-minutes. Plasma PRL, TSH, and T4 also increased and remained slightly elevated at 4 hours. These 8-hour studies were performed in a puerperal lactating woman who had ingested 10 mg of TRH orally twice a day for 7 days prior to blood sampling. TRH concentrations declined throughout each day while TSH rose slightly in the first 1 to 2 hours but remained within normal limits. The prolonged administration of 10 mg of TRH orally twice daily to three puerperally lactating women resulted in elevations in plasma TRH 2 to 3 hours following hormone administration, yet no significant increases in plasma TSH were observed. Both endogenous TRH and TSH were measured before and after 22 nursing events in nine puerperally lactating women. There was no change in the concentration of either substance and all values were similar to those obtained in normally menstruating women.',\n",

In an urban population in Canada, breast feeding was associated with a marked decrease in the occurrence of otitis and respiratory disease and to a lesser extent of diarrhoea and dehydration. In newborn siblings of children with atopic disease exclusively breast-fed for a minimum of six weeks, the incidence of eczema, recurrent wheezing, elevated serum IgE-antibodies to cow's milk, complement activation in vivo after milk challenge and hemagglutinating antibodies to beta-lactoglobulin was significantly lower compared with formula-fed matched group.

       " {'abstract': 'The effect of trans-4-amino-methyl-cyclohexane acid (AMCA) and a placebo preparation on the development of alveolitis sicca dolorosa (ASD) was investigated in a double-blind designed experiment. The preoperative registrations were age, sex, use of oral contraceptives, menstrual cycle, smoking, degree of impaction and operation time. The study included 120 healthy persons. Each person had bilateral impacted mandibular molars removed surgically at one session. AMCA (160 mg/extraction site) or placebor was applied in each socket after the operation. The postoperative course was evaluated on average 5 days later by the use of 13 different variables describing local and general discomfort. The incidence of ASD was 7.5% in the AMCA side and 5.0% in the placebo side. The result shows that a local inhibition of plasminogen activation by AMCA is insufficient to prevent the development of ASD. The occurrence of ASD and postoperative discomfort was not increased in women operated during the menstrual period. The usage of oral contraceptives is known to be associated with a high frequency of ASD. Women taking oral contraceptives may therefore postpone the operation to the withdrawal period of the pill, to reduce the risk of developing ASD. Postoperative pains and the consumption of analgetics were significantly increased in patients who were habitual smokers.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Some geneticists have been against induction of ovulation because there is a greater incidence of chromosome abnormalities in spontaneous abortions that occur after induced pregnancies. We have found the number of early abortions (15.6  p. 100) and of malformed fetuses (4.8 p. 100) is not greater than average when we have studied a personal prospective series of 140 pregnancies and a series of 519 pregnancies collected following an enquiry made among some of our colleagues. The number of late abortions and of premature labours is much higher (3.4 p. 100 and 14.8 p. 100 respectively) and they correspond particularly with the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies (12.3 p. 100) which have been obtained especially after the use of HMG. This has a direct repercussion on perinatal mortality (4.3 p. 100).',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The responses of serum TSH and PRL to TRH (500 microgram) were studied in normal young women in the early follicular, periovulatory, and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle in order to examine the relationship of these responses to the levels of estradiol relationship of these responses to the levels of estradiol (E2) and progesterone. Each woman was studied twice in each phase in order to assess intraindividual variability. There was no significant difference in either the TSH or PRL responses among the phases of the menstrual cycle nor was either response affected by the periovulatory rise in E2 or by the luteal rise in both E2 and progesterone. Thus, the interpretation of the TSH and PRL responses to TRH in normal women is not affected by the menstrual cycle although both responses are greater in women that in men. Both the peak TSH and peak PRL after TRH were highly correlated with the basal levels of TSH (r = 0.85; P less than 0.01) and PRL (r = 0.67; P less than 0.01), respectively, indicating that the TSH and PRL responses to TRH in women are directly proportionate to the basal levels of the respective hormones, as previously shown for the TSH response in men. The mean intraindividual variability (coefficient of variation) of the TSH response to TRH was 18%, but ranged as high as 56%, while that of the PRL response was 16% and ranged up to 31%; variability was not affected by the phase of the menstrual cycle. The normal range of the peak TSH after TRH in women is 7-33 microU/ml (mean +/- 2 SD); however, because of the variability, a normal woman may sometimes have a peak TSH after TRH as low as 4 microU/ml. Repeating the test will result in a normal value if the woman is truly normal. Similarly, the normal peak PRL after TRH in women is 22-111 ng/ml (mean +/- 2 SD); usually, however, the lower limit is 30 ng/ml with lower values due to intraindividual variation. The data suggest that the higher average level of E2 in women compared to women, but that the cyclic changes in serum E2 or progesterone in women have little or no additional effect.',\n",

This RRA was used to determine the time of ovulation in seven women. For comparison, four hourly values around midcycle were measured by RIA. The sensitivity of the RRA was 0.78 ng/ml serum and could be increased by prolonged incubation. The coefficient of within and between assay variation at the 50% inhibition level was 7% and 13%, respectively. The mean index of discrimination (RRA/RIA) was 1.02, expressed by the slope of the regression curve. The coefficient of correlation was 0.97. In all women, the LH surge was detected by RRA, and the subsequent ovulation was verified within 30 h by endoscopic examination of the ovaries, as well as serum progesterone concentrations of more than 5 ng/ml on the fifth day after ovulation. As shown, prospective ovulation timing can be done by this simple and accurate method. The RRA can be useful in infertility therapy such as artificial insemination.',\n",

Although it is logical to assume that after most tubal ligations the intramural segment remains normal and end-to-end anastomosis is possible, both segments should be evaluated and tested prior to the plastic reconstruction. The results of 178 operations collected from the literature and the author's 23 attempts at surgical reversal of previous tubal operations for surgical sterilization were described. The over-all pregnancy rate after resection and end-to-end anastomosis was 39.0%; after uterotubal implantation, it was 19.4%. The latter procedure was performed in 60% of the patients. The small series of reports makes it difficult to evaluate conception rates or to judge the merits of specific reconstructive operative techniques.\",\n",

Animal studies revealed inadequate prevention of pregnancy by tubocclusive methods from within the uterus, and the laparoscopic route was chosen. A series of clips were evaluated, and a clip was designed which would have a spring load, be wide enough to cause true tissue necrosis, have a firm grip on the tube to prevent dislodgement, and have a smooth external surface. Extensive human trials of the clip and applicator have resulted in over 1,000 patients with clips applied by 27 physicians in 10 centers throughout the world. Six pregnancies appear to have been due so far to application onto structures other than the isthmic portion of the tube. Complications due to the clip itself appear to be minimal, and the feasibility of performing this operation under local anesthesia in a hospital facility other than the operating room is currently under evaluation.',\n",

The thermal damage to the fallopian tube caused by different energies and coagulation durations was examined microscopically. During the coagulation of the fallopian tube, with an energy of 20-30 watt temperatures of around 100 degrees C are produced at the point of coagulation. The effective coagulation time is dependant upon the energy created and the duration of the coagulation. The best histologic results were obtained with a duration of the coagulation of 60 seconds at an energy of 30 watts. This corresponds to an effective coagulation time of 50 seconds. The temperature of the coagulation instrument becomes normal within 1 to 2 minutes after the coagulation. If the electric energy is increased to 50 or 100 watt, sparking is observed almost consistently. With these energies, temperatures up to 600 degrees C are observed. The temperature of the metal parts of the coagulation forceps then become normal after 3-4 minutes. In order to avoid burns during laparoscopic tubal sterilizations and in order to obtain a good histologic result the procedure should be done with an electrical energy of 30 watt and a duration of the coagulation of 60 seconds.',\n",

As of March 1974, more than 1000 patients had undergone the procedure, usually performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting, with no fixed contraindications. Complications and pregnancy rates based on a preliminary 6-month follow-up are presented. Complications due to application of the clip appeared to be limited to postoperative cramps lasting 24 to 48 hours (26% of the patients). No ectopic pregnancies were reported. Pregnancies, when corrected for unsuspected pregnancies and misapplication of the clip, occurred in 2 of these first 1000 patients. The difficulties and relative contraindications learned from this unselected series and the advantages over electrocagulation  techniques are discussed.',\n",

In 40% of the diagnostic laparoscopies, normal findings were seen and in 11%, a different abnormal finding than suspected was found. In 3% of women, the findings could not be elucidated by laparoscopy. None of the 617 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal sterilization have become pregnant. In 5% of the patients (0.6%) complications occurred. In 3 cases a laparotomy became necessary. In 2 cases there was bleeding from the fallopian tube or the greater omentum and in 1 case there was a trauma to the intestine. Laparoscopic tubal sterilization by the single puncture technique and coagulation without division of the tube only, is considered to be the lowest risk method of the laparoscopic tubal sterilizations.',\n",

The diabetes was allowed to stabilize for at least 15 days, whereafter the testicular and seminal vesicle histology was studied at various time intervals. Reduction in testis weights and tubule diameters was significant after 2 weeks of diabetes. The changes in seminiferous tubules ranged from premature sloughing of epithelium to total cessation of spermatogenesis. The testicular histology of diabetic animals frequently greatly simulated the situation described following hypophysectomy. By subjective visual assessment the number of Leydig cells was found to be normal or reduced in all of the diabetic animals. Diabetes was also demonstrated to induce seminal vesicle atrophy, which did not show any correlation with the degree of testicular lesions.

       " {'abstract': 'The time (interval, postpartum, postabortum), location (uterus, mucus membrane of the oviducts, tubes), access (transcervical, transvaginal, trans-abdominal) and the actual method of sterilization for the women (surgical, electric, thermic, mechanical) can be differentiated and combined with each other in various ways. Today the usual procedure is sterilization by partial resection of the oviducts performed laparoscopically in the interval via electrocoagulation and surgically after delivery via periumbilical minilaparotomy. Laparoscopic sterilization via electrocoagulation has a rate of failure of about 1:1,000 and the mortality rate is less than 1:10,000. The most frequent complications are: hemorrhages due to injury of the larger vessels and burns in the intestine caused by the electric current. For this reason, conventional (:unipolar\") electrocoagulation should be replaced by the so-called bipolar coagulation or other newer methods which avoid these complications. On the basis of the current literature, no definitive statements can be made regarding the reliability of the newer methods (silastic ring, plastic clips, thermocoagulation). An additional, although up until now purely hypothetic, advantage of the newer methods is the possibility of reversibility. With conventional electrocoagulation, the rate of reversilbility is very low. Additional alternatives are also culdotomy and minilaparotomy in the interval with the assistance of a uterus elevator. Both ways of access may be combined with various methods of sterilization. The pros and cons of the hysterectomy as a method of sterilization are still being discussed. Occasional late sequelae of sterilization such as menstrual disorders, pain and, particularly, problems related to sexual intercourse have only recently come to light. They have not yet been adequately investigated.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'During a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters. Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups. Severe complications developed in four patients. All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile, suggesting \"hypercoagulability\" before initiation of therapy. Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy. One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained. One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy. The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy. All four patients were of the A or AB blood group. Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen. It appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term oral contraceptive therapy.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The association of excessive circulating androgens in blood and ovulatory failure in women is well documented in a variety of clinical conditions. The restoration of ovulatory function by wedge resection of the polycystic ovary, by the administration of glucocorticoids or removal of tumors of the adrenal or ovary--measures that also reduce the level of circulating androgens--is also well documented. In view of the many hypotheses of adrenal and ovarian abnormalities and disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in the human, resulting in hirsutism and ovulatory failure, a normal intact rat model was developed to study the effect of androgens on ovulation. The administration of a weak androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA), to immature rats resulted in a single precocious ovulation followed by ovulatory failure. The conversion of DHA to estrogens appeared to be the principle mechanism for the precocious ovulation. The steps appeared to be an elevation in blood estradiol, followed by the depletion of cytoplasmic estradiol receptors of the hypothalamus and pituitary and the gonadotropin surge leading to ovulation. These events appeared to be similar to those occuring in the adult cycling rat, in precocious puberty induced by the administration of pregnant mare serum gonadotropins and during the onset of natural puberty. The role of estrogens in inducing the precocious ovulation was further supported by the absence of precocious ovulation in animals in which the conversion of DHA to estrogens was blocked or by administering androgens that could not be converted to estrogens. In contrast, the subsequent ovulatory failure could not be explained entirely by the conversion of DHA to estrogens. There was a considerable time lag between the withdrawal of DHA treatment and the replenishment of pituitary and hypothalamic cytoplasmic estradiol receptors. Unlike those of the cycling animal, the receptors were not replenished when the levels of circulating  estradiol in blood receded. The replenishment occurred only after the circulating levels of androstenedione, DNA and progesterone were reduced. Receptor replenishment in the hypothalamus and pituitary was followed by increases in the levels of circulating gonadotropins, particularly LH, with subsequent restoration of cyclic ovulatory function. The ovaries in the acyclic androgen-treated rat were responsive to gonadotropins. The pituitary responded to LH-RH administration, but the sensitivity was reduced. In the adult rat, ovulatory failure and the formation of polycystic ovaries took place with doses of DHA as low as 7.5 mg per kg of body weight. Attempts are being made to obtain further insights into the mechanism of androgen-induced ovulatory failure by studying the effect of androgens and progesterone on the steroid receptors and their function in the hypothalamus and the pituitary. Furthermore, a direct effect of DHA on the ovary, causing follicular atresia and cystic changes, is also being explored.',\n",

The samples were obtained from 18 women in the age from 23--62 years. Some of them were treated by various steroid hormones. Endosalpinx ciliary ATPase-activity represents dynein and is therefore an indicator of ciliary motility. Estrogens and gestagens have a different influence on the ATPase-activity. All cilia of one ciliated cell react in the same manner and may be regarded as a reaction unit. The relation of negative to positive ciliary borders differs characteristically in the tubal isthmus, ampulls and infundibulum and coincides with commonly known phenomena of egg transport through the oviduct. Postovulatory, reaction units increase in ampulla and infundibulum compared with the proliferative phase. The oviducts of postmenopausal women possess but a scanty outfit of reaction units. Short-time treatment with estrogen in the early secretory phase results in a great number of reaction units in all tubal segments; a similar treatment in the proliferative phase diminishes the reaction units in the ampulla. Midcycle progesterone treatment activates the ciliary ATPase in the isthmus. Low doses of lynestrenol (minipill) in the proliferative phase leads to a decrease of reaction units in all tubal segments; the pattern of ciliary reaction under low doses of lynestrenol at the time of ovulation coincides with that of the proliferative phase. Treatment with a contraceptive steroid (0,05 mg ethinylestradiol and 0,25 d-norgestrel) causes a considerable activation of the ciliary ATPase in all portions of the oviduct.',\n",

The circadian rhythm was studied during 13 3-hour sampling periods (36 h) which were identical in all subjects. Dehydroepiandrosterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone and pregnenolone showed a marked circadian rhythm with highest mean levels in the morning between 06.00 and 0.900 h and lowest mean levels during the night between 21.00 and 24.00 h. The peak levels of individual subjects coincided completely with the highest mean levels in the case of dehydroepiandrosterone, in 9 out of 10 cases with regard to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and in 8 of 10 cases as far as pregnenolone levels were concerned. The lowest individual levels were more dispersed around the means than were the individual peaks. The difference between the highest (morning hours: 06.00-09.00) and lowest (evening hours: 21.00-24.00) geometeric mean values was 404% for 17-hydroxypregnenolone, 163% for dehydroepiandrosterone and 71% for pregnenolone. The mean testosterone levels also exhibited an elevation between 06.00 and 09.00 h which was significant (P less than 0.05). However, the individual peak values were scattered from 21.00 h of the first day to 18.00 h of the second day. The mean concentrations of androstendine showed a significant increase between 06.00 and 18.00 h. The individual peaks were widely dispersed. Hence a uniform circadian rhythm correlated to the levels of the 5-steroids mentioned above could not be demonstrated in the case of testosterone and androstenedione. An analysis of variance indicated no significant differences between sampling periods as far as dihydrotestosterone levels were concerned. The extent and regularity of the circadian variation in the plasma levels of the 5-steroids studied makes it mandatory to standardize very carefully the exact time of blood withdrawal in any longitudinal study. In view of the sharp changes in the plasma levels during the morning hours, it is suggested that sampling during the afternoon period may provide more constant values.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone in hirsute women suffering from either idiopathic hirsutism or the polycystic ovary syndrome were determined before and during treatment with cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl oestradiol. During this treatment the hirsutism decreased markedly. In untreated hirsute women serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels do not differ from those in normal women and do not change during therapy; androstenedione levels are higher than normal and decrease markedly during treatment, and the testosterone levels are elevated compared to normals, with a considerable overlap, and show only a tendency to decrease. There is no correlation between dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione levels or between androstenedione and testosterone levels in the serum of untreated hirsute women. After 12-14 months of cyproterone acetate-ethinyl oestradiol therapy a linear correlation is found between dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione levels. This can be explained by the relatively higher contribution of the peripheral conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone to androstenedione to the occurrence of lower androstenedione levels. The linear correlation between androstenedione and testosterone after treatment, also found in normal women, indicates the restoration of the role of androstenedione as the major peripheral precursor of testosterone.',\n",

Fourteen adult female squirrel monkeys were induced to ovulate with 4 or 5 days' treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone (1 mg) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (500 IU). Natural mating with a fertile male or artificial insemination was performed near the time of ovulation. Thirty-six hours and eleven days after HCG administration, the females were laparoscoped to determine whether ovulation had occurred. Under laparoscopic control, 1.2 to 3 ml of warmed saline were flushed through the uterine lumen 4 to 7 and 15 to 17 days after HCG administration. Flushed fluid was recovered with a plyethylene catheter or a Pasteur pipette inserted into the cleaned vagina. Fifty-eight uterine flushings were performed, with an average of 65.4% fluid recovery. Six nonfertilized ova and two preimplantation blastocysts were recovered by this technique.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': \"The endocrine response to prolonged dexamethasone treatment was investigated in six postmenopausal women with generalized mammary carcinoma. Plasma cortisol levels decreased rapidly and became undetectable whereas significant concentrations of plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione persisted throughout the study, even in two ovariectomized patients, indicating a certain degree of autonomy or a greater resistance of adrenal 'androgens' to the inhibition of ACTH secretion. Except in the ovariectomized patients, plasma testosterone did not fall significantly whereas the plasma oestrogens tended progressively towards undetectable concentrations. A similar response was found in six normal postmenopausal women although the disappearance of their oestrogens was relatively rapid. This indicates that much of the testosterone present after the menopause could still be produced by the ovaries whereas the ovarian production of oestrogens becomes negligible. The delayed disappearance of oestrogens in the patients with mammary carcinoma indicates that the persisting adrenal 'androgens' remained efficient precursors of oestrogen synthesis within the peripheral tissues and presumably within the mammary tumour itself. Plasma dihydrotestosterone behaved like the plasma oestrogens. Despite the fall in plasma oestrogens, plasma gonadotrophins did not increase further but plasma prolactin rose progressively. The persistance of steroid sex hormones and the rise of plasma prolactin might explain the poor response to dexamethasone treatment in mammary carcinoma.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Calusterone (7beta, 17alpha-dimethyltestosterone) is a 17-alkylated, orally active androgenic steroid used in the treatment of breast cancer. The effect of this steroid on the metabolism of 14C-testosterone and the excretion of endogenous urinary androgen metabolites has been studied in four patients with breast cancer. Total glucuronide metabolites of the tracer decreased significantly, the andorsterone/etiocholanolone ratio rose by a factor of 2-4, and there was increased formation of uncharacterized polar metabolites. There was no significant change in either the sum of the excretion of endogenous androgen metabolites or the androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio. The changes resemble those we have seen in cirrhosis of the liver. It is concluded that the effects of Calusterone on testosterone metabolism, like its effects on cortisol or estradiol metabolism, represent nonspecific effects of an orally administered 17-alkylated steroid on hepatic structure and function, and probably bear no relationship to its therapeutic effect in breast cancer.',\n",

However, the failure rate appears to be higher than that of the coagulation-alone method, at least in the postabortal patient. The necessity for pathologic confirmation, a tradition of surgery, is critically questioned. Additional coagulation of the tubal ends after resection is now recommended, especially in the patient seeking abortion as well as sterilization. The authors await the comparative long-term results of bipolar forceps and the newer mechanical methods of laparoscopic tubal sterilization. It is conceivable that the snare and other unipolar electrosurgical instruments designed for female sterilization will become obsolete.',\n",

Electrocoagulation, spring-loaded clips or tubal rings were the methods used for tubal occlusion. All laparoscopies were performed in a family planning clinic. The surgical facilities were minimal and did not include general anesthesia equipment or a blood bank. The nearest hospital was about one-half mile from the clinic. The procedures were performed by a physician assisted by two paramedical personnel and a technician. Patients were scheduled to be at the clinic on the morning of the procedure and were discharged three to six hours after the procedure. Only one patient required hospitalization for treatment of a complication: her aorta was punctured during placement of the Tuohy needle. The patient was admitted to a local hospital and underwent laparotomy for repair; her subsequent recovery was uneventful. No bowel or bladder burns have occurred. Minor complications (emphysema of the abdominal wall, bleeding from the tubes, infections) have occurred in less than 4% of the patients. The results of this study indicate that laparoscopy in an outpatient clinic is safe and presents minimal additional risks to the patient if the surgeon is experienced.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The metabolism of nine radioactively labeled steroids in the epithelium of the seminal vesicle of the mature guinea pig has been studied. The rapid assimilation and metabolism of these steroids demostrate the very active biochemical nature of this tissue. Based on the use of several thin-layer chromatography systems and comparison with the locations of known standards, the following have been disclosed. Testosterone was rapidly converted to dihydrostestosterone and androstanediol. The latter was the major metablolite of dihydrotestosterone and of androsterone. Androstenedione was readily converted to androstanedione, testosterone, and dihydrostestosterone, although it formed little androstanediol. Dehydroepiandrosterone was converted to small amounts of androstenediol and androstanediol. Pregnenolone was rapidly converted to an unidentified highly polar compound only. Progesterone was converted to 5alpha-pregnane-3beta-ol-20-one and its 3alpha-isomer. Dehydroepiandrosterone and progesterone were also significantly converted to unidentified highly polar compounds. The major metabolites of 17-hydroxyprogesterone co-chromatographed with standard androstanediol, testosterone, and unidentified metabolite possessing intermediate chromatographic mobility. In addition, 17-hydroxyprogesterone was converted to small amounts of compounds possessing identical Rf values as standard androstenedione and dihydrostestosterone. The identification of the products of 17-hydroxyprogesterone metabolism and their physiologic significance must await critical evaluation. Because of its homogeneity, isolated epithelium of guinea pig seminal vesicle shows promise as a tissue preparation for use in future studies that might elucidate the role(s) of individual androgens in secretory tissues of the male accessory sex organs. Our demonstration of extensive steroid interconversions in this tissue is a logical prerequisite to such studies.',\n",

Of these, 2,143 were effected via laparoscopy. The following complications occurred which required laparotomy: in two cases, hemorrhages from the abdominal cavity as a result of the second puncture, in one case from the mesosalpinx, and, as a late complication, two extrauterine pregnancies. The method failed in the case of the two extrauterine pregnancies and possibly also in the case of two doubtful intrauterine pregnancies (0.8--1.7 per thousand). Today this surgical measure is being performed in Tübingen exclusively by the single-puncture technique an increasingly under local anesthesia. The advantages of the method are an accurately determinable coagulation zone, sparing of the mesosalpinx, low incidence of complications, absence of life-threatening incidents, and low failure quota.',\n",

Progesterone, medrogestone, clogestone, medroxyprogesterone acetate and calusterone reduce the specific oestradiol-receptor interaction in vitro; this effect is dose-dependent and does not differ significantly from one drug to the other. A more relevant decrease in the amount of oestradiol-17beta bound to specific receptors has been observed with calusterone. Progesterone, clogestone, medrogestone, medroxyprogesterone acetate and calusterone given orally induce a marked decrease (between 30 and 70% depending on the dose) in the binding capacity of oestradiol-17beta to specific uterine receptors in vivo. Results from a Scatchard plot analysis suggest that the interference with the binding of oestradiol-17beta caused by both progestogens and calusterone is due to a non-competitive interaction.',\n",

For precision surgery through the colposcope, the carbon dioxide laser beam appears to be useful in the control of neoplastic lesions of the vaginal mucosa and possibly of the cervix uteri. Tumor volume reduction through laser vaporization, especially when a recurrent tumor is attached to the bony pelvis, is an outstanding advantage. Adhesiolysis during myomectomy and reconstructive surgery of the fallopian tubes might be facilitated by the laser beam. Laser surgery on the vulva, both colposcopically directed and grossly with the CO2 laser scalpel, might prove to be important for the treatment of various lesions. Detailed technical knowledge, rigid safety precautions, and judicious clinical considerations are essential for competent laser surgery.',\n",

All three androgenic steroids and their two C21 precursors were reduced in the oral contraceptive users compared with the controls.

       " {'abstract': 'Dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate (DS), the major C19-steroid in the human circulation, was measured in serum obtained from blood samples collected daily (8 to 10 A.M.) throughout the menstrual cycles of eight normal, presumably ovulatory women and daily throughout the treatment cycles in four women taking an oral contraceptive (norethindrone, 1 mg., plus mestranol, 80 mcg.). The serum concentrations of DS in the ovulatory women ranged from 1,025 to 4,200 ng. per milliliter; mean, 2,062 +/- 137 ng. per milliliter (mean and standard error; n = 213). Serum DS concentrations during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycles of these women were similar. In women taking the oral contraceptive, the plasma DS concentrations ranged from 475 to 1,400 ng. per milliliter (mean, 895 +/- 83; n = 119). The 24 hour secretory pattern of DS was evaluated in one subject during a nontreatment cycle and again after 20 days of oral contraceptive treatment. In this subject, the mean serum DS level was 34 per cent lower during oral contraceptive treatment than the level before treatment. The decrease in the serum concentration of DS during oral contraceptive treatment likely results from a reduction in adrenal DS secretion since DS secretion by the normal human ovary is negligible and ovarian dehydroisoandrosterone secretion is small. Therefore, it is likely that the reduced serum DS levels in women taking oral contraceptives are the consequence of reduced adrenal secretion of DS resulting from reduced release of adrenocorticotropic hormone.',\n",

Severity of the deleterious gene and visibility of the carrier status are two important factors to consider in an estimation of potential stigma.

       " {'abstract': 'After any trauma to the fallopian tubes by a sterilizing operation, pregnancy occurs. If the sterilizing procedure was by high frequency current coagulation, large areas of the fallopian tube must be destroyed down into the mesosalpinx in order to avoid the preprogrammed recanalization tendency of the muellerian duct. Fertilization has occurred in recanalized fallopian tubes which only showed a cubic epithelium. Extensive destruction of the fallopian tube is today not justifiable because of the possibility of interference with the ovarian blood supply and subsequent hormonal damage. At present the safest method of female sterilization is by tissue coagulation of segment of the fallopian tube at 100 centigrade and division of the coagulated portion. In 1000 cases there were no pregnancies.',\n",

Of these 10.7% were for diagnostic purposes only, in 3.6% of the cases laparoscopy was combined with biopsie and in 85.7% with tubal sterilization. Deaths or serious bleedings did not occur, laparotomies were not necessary. Total insignificant complications amounted to 1.6% (1.3% small bleedings which did not necessitate an operation and in 0.3% clinical signs of peritonitis, these disappeared after 3 to 15 days). In 0.7% laparoscopy was interrupted because of poor vision. Nine of 2055 women became pregnant after sterilization (4.5 pregnancies/1000 sterilizations). In 2 cases the ligamentum rotundum was coagulated, in 7 cases recanalization was histologically confirmed. Until Oct. 1975 coagulation was unipolar, afterwords bipolar. In 45.3% the patients had undergone an operation before, like Ceasarian section, gallbladder operation, appendectomy or umbilical hernia operation. Patients with longitudinal incision, with preceding peritonitis or ileus were excluded from laparoscopy. Laparoscopy was performed by all assistents during their last year of clinical instruction. Their first 30 laparoscopies were done under control, every assistent performed about 100 laparoscopies.',\n",

Simultaneous culdocentesis was performed to obtain peritoneal fluid for microbiologic analysis. A variety of microorganisms were isolated from the fallopian tubes and cul-de-sac aspirate. However, the organisms isolated from the fallopian tube were not consistent with the cul-de-sac isolates. It appears that direct culture from the fallopian tube may be necessary to determine the microbiologic etiology and pathogenesis of acute salpingitis. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated from the cul-de-sac in 32 per cent of cases and the fallopian tube in 19 per cent. In patients with endocervical gonorrhea, the gonococcus was isolated from the fallopian tube in 38.5 per cent of cases. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were present in the cul-de-sac aspirate in 46 per cent of patients and in the fallopian tube in 38 per cent.',\n",

The electrocautery method was complicated by electrical burns in 13 cases (0.29%); 3 of these patients required bowel resections. Mechanical complications occurred in 1.6% of the Silastic-ring cases, but none of the patients required additional surgery. The Silastic-ring patients had greater postoperative abdominal pain than the electrocautery patients, but it usually abated within 48 hours. There were 15 cases of postoperative pelvic infection in the electrocautery group, and none in the Silastic-ring group. Bleeding from the mesosalpinx occurred in both groups and occurred more often with coincident suction D&C. Technical failure to perform the sterilization procedure was principally related to previous abdominal surgery. A substantial number of patients complained of menstrual irregularity and/or dysmenorrhea following these sterilization procedures. The majority of women reported unchanged or improved sexual relations. Improvement in sexual relations was reported by significantly more patients in the Silastic-ring group than in the electrocautery group.',\n",

Failed attempts were encountered in one of 150 patients, the main causes of which were adhaesions and difficulties at establishing pneumoperitoneum. The failure rate of the laparoscopic electrocoagulation of the fallopian tube after a long-term follow-up was about 0,5%, 20--25% of these were ectopic pregnancies. The transection of the fallopian tubes did not diminish the pregnancy rate, but the risk of bleeding was considerably higher with this technic.

The selection of patients for the procedure requires careful counseling in order to avoid the risk of regret. Factors increasing the risk of regret are enumerated. Laparoscopy is the most popular method for sterilization, but mini laparotomy is a reasonable alternative for patients not having access to skilled laparoscopists. Clips and rings provide a greater chance of successful reversal of sterilization, and are recommended for use in younger women. The sequelae of sterilization are slight, with failure of technique, infection and temporary regret being the commonest. Serious psychological or physical sequelae are rare. If reversal is required the microsurgical technique is recommended.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Controversy exists over the proper methods of sterilizing laparoscopic telescopes. An edict requiring gas sterilization rather than solution soaking of these instruments is in force in all federal hospitals. This rule has necessitated capital investments for new instruments and has led to a severe reduction in the number of cases of laparoscopy that may be scheduled in one day. Fear of contamination is based on theoretical considerations and rusn counter to the actual, observed safety record seen with laparoscopes soaked in activated glutaraldehyde between cases. In an effort to dispassionately approach this problem, cultures of the umbilical area, the laparoscope and the pelvic serosal surfaces were taken to document the type of organisms commonly encountered under clinical conditions. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as for fungi were taken after soaking the telescope in activated glutaraldehyde. The results demonstrated growth of common skin organisms even after skin preparation with povidone-iodine and ethyl alcohol. Similar organisms were recovered in some cases from the laparoscope and the pelvic surfaces. The actual degree of contamination suggested by a colony count falls well within the range of the healthy peritoneum to cope with these organisms. Recommendations for laparoscopic sterilization or disinfection are based on the results obtained.',\n",

The difference in the mean total gross tubal burn produced by the 2 methods is not statistically significant. The variance of total tubal burn in individual cases within each group is significantly greater in the electrocoagulation group. The authors assume that pregnancy rates in patients undergoing thermal coagulation and division will be no different than those reported in patients in the electrocoagulation and division group.

The prevalence at birth is shown to have fallen from 1.70 per 1000 births in the period 1961--65 to 0.84 per 1000 births in 1971--75. The fall in prevalence can be shown to be largely due to a change in distribution of maternal age. An earlier increase in the number of Down Syndrome children is shown to reflect a greatly improved survival in the first 5 yr of life to a continuing level of 81%. The number of Down Syndrome children is unlikely to increase much even with increase of birth rate unless older mothers have further pregnancies. For these reasons the policies of amniocentesis of older women and termination of affected pregnancies will have progressively less effect on the number of affected children if this demographic trend continues. A further effect is that special schools will have a proportionately greater burden as the younger children being admitted have less prospect of development and may be more demanding of staff than Down Syndrome children.',\n",

Certain indications have stayed stable, such as chronic pain in the pelvis, masses found in the pelvis, symptoms suggestive of upper genital tract infection or of ectopic pregnancy and tubal or unexplained sterility. Stability in these indications is correct because laparoscopy and laparoscopy alone can give a precise diagnosis of the lesion and complete the clinical findings and the other methods of investigation. There are two indications which have become less frequent and these are: ovarian sterility and amenorrhoea. This is logical since more reliance has come to be placed on biological methods. Laparoscopy should be reserved in these conditions for cases where are contradictions between biological findings or where there are therapeutic failures. An increase in the indications which is very justified is in those laparoscopies which are carried out as a control of the results of tubal surgery, because there a prognosis can be given and therapy can be carried out (such as division of adhesions) and in cases of malignant tumours of the ovary which, although the procedure will give less precise information than laparotomy, has the advantage that it can be repeated from time to time.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'A continuous prospective series of 100 cases of severe acute genital infections which were collected over a period of 16 months at the Gynaecological and Obstetrical Clinic of the Saint Antoine Hospital has been studies using the same protocol. Analysing the history given by these patients before the onset of the illness shows how young they were and how frequently they were nulliparous, as well as the role of intra-uterine contraceptive devices. The correlation between the clinical features and those found on laparoscopy which was carried out almost routinely shows the great advantages of this examination. The authors in their discussion have tried, by analysing groups of symptoms, to show that to make an early correct diagnosis laparoscopy has to be used in a majority of cases. It allows treatment to be instituted quickly and unhesitatingly. Furthermore, it is justified because: It is necessary to find out all lesions that are present and which are unpredictable clinically. It renders it possible to carry out therapeutic manoeuvres (such as cutting adhesions and giving antibiotics locally) and to take swabs for bacteriological examination (this will be discussed in the second part of this article).',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Specific receptor binding of estradiol (E-2) and dihydrotestosterone  (DHT) was studied in human myometrial tissue and in human mammary cancer tissue. The inhibition of binding for E-2 and DHT by E-2, testosterone (T), DHT, dehydroepiandosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), androstendione (A) and 5-androstene-3beta, 17beta-diol (Adiol) was tested with the use of dextran-coated charcoal separation of bound and free E-2, respectively, and DHT. The percentage of binding inhibition was calculated with reference to the inhibition obtained with nafoxidine in a molar concentration ratio of 1,000 for E-2 binding, respectively, with cyproterone acetate in a molar concentration ratio of 10,000 for DHT binding. In 15 samples of myometrium tested, receptors were found for both E-2 and DHT. From 19 samples of mammary carcinoma tissue one showed no binding activity, three samples did bind E-2 only, five samples DHT only, and ten samples showed binding of both steroids. A 50% inhibition of E-2 binding, in myometrial as well as in tumor tissue, required a molar concentration ratio of 40 for Adiol, of more than 2,000 for DHEA. No significant inhibiting activity could be found for A up to a molar concentration ratio of 10,000 and for DHEA-S up to 40,000. With regard to DHT binding, Adiol is more active than E-2 and less active than T. Of the substances tested Adiol is therefore the only one which exerts a significant inhibiting influence at a molar ratio not far beyond the physiological range. This signifies that Adiol might interfere at the receptor level in the estrogenic stimulation of mammary cancer cells.',\n",

Over 95% of the recovered activity was found as conjugated steroids and these were separated into four groups by chromatography of the urine extract on Sephadex LH-20 with chloroform-methanol (1/1) + 0.01M NaCl. The two major conjugate fractions appeared to be almost exclusively glucosiduronates. Enzymatic hydrolysis liberated at least ten different EE2 metabolites as shown by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 with benzene-methanol (85/15). After additional separation and purification of these metabolites, positive identification was obtained for nine radioactive compounds by either gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or reverse-isotope recrystallization. Five were ethynyl compounds: EE2, 2-MeO EE2, 16beta-OH EE2, 2-OH EE2 and 6alpha-OH EE2.

Postgonococcal urethritis (PGU) developed in 11 of 11 men who had C. trum antibody to C. trachomatisis developed. The immunotype specificity of chlamydial antibody corresponded to the immunotype isolated. Among culture-negative patients. chlamydial antibody prevalence correlated with the number of past sex partners and with previous NGU. Herpesvirus hominis, cytomegalovirus, T-mycoplasma, Mycoplasma hominis, other bacteria, and Trichomonas vaginalis were not implicated in NGU or PGU. Thus, the cause of chlamydia-negative NGU and PGU remains obscure. Endocervical chlamydia were found in sex partners of 15 of 22 NGU patients with and two of 24 without urethral chlamydial infection (p smaller than 0.001).

Mammary tumors occurred in nearly 14% of 875 female dogs with neoplasms. Nearly 60% of 128 neoplasms were located in the 4th and 5th mammary glands. Of the 128 cancers in these 120 dogs, 85 were classified as duct carcinoma, 38 as lobular carcinoma, 3 as malignant mixed tumor, and 2 as duct and lobular carcinomas. Most duct carcinomas originated in the epithelial cells of ducts at all levels, and a few arose in previously benign duct papillomas. The lobular carcinomas arose in alveoli and developed into progressively larger lobules. A negative factor in the development of mammary cancer is ovariectomy before or shortly after the first estrous cycle in the dog and before the age of 40 in women. In both dog and man, aging is a positive factor in the development of mammary cancer. In women, other positive factors are nulliparity and inheritance; e.g., a high rate of breast cancer in close female relatives of Jewish extraction. An epidemiologic study of breast cancer in man and dog in high-risk countries(e.g., United States) and low-risk countries (e.g., Japan) is indicated.',\n",

The records of 81 of the 98 patients whose tumors were characterized for estrogen receptor content and who had received some type of endocrine therapy were reviewed by a peer review group that assessed the objective data for these patients regarding objective remission or failure to treatment. A positive estrophilin determination was defined as receptor content greater than 250 fmole per gram of tumor for premenopausal females and greater than 750 fmole per gram of tumor for postmenopausal and previously castrated patients. Estrogen receptor determinations may be made from tumor specimens as small as 200 mg. Sixty-nine patients underwent some form of ablative therapy. Twenty-seven of these patients were found to have significant receptor determinations. Of those patients in whom a definite determination was made of their post-treatment response, roughly two-thirds experienced objective remissions. None of the 42 patients with negative estrogen receptor determination experienced an objective remission to ablative endocrine therapy. Only one of 6 patients with negative determinations benefited from additive hormonal therapy; 4 of 6 patients with positive determinations benefited from additive therapy. Not all women with receptor containing mammary cancer will respond favorably to endocrine therapy, but those patients whose tumors lack a critical amount of estrophilin have little chance of benefit from either endocrine ablation or hormone administration. The estrogen receptor content of the primary tumor indicates the hormonal dependency of the tumor and may be used to predict the response to endocrine treatment when recurrent disease appears.',\n",

They survived storage best in the presence of components of egg yolk which were non-dialysable and were not filtered through membranes which retained substances of molecular weight greater than 100 000. The substances isolated in peak B of the ion-exchange chromatogram of whole egg yolk described by Seideman et al.

Whereas sequential removal of the sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose residues led to a progressive increase in the effective dose of the hormone required to stimulate steroidogenesis, it resulted in a marked loss in the ability of the hormone to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation. Low doses of the glycosidase-treated hormone derivatives were additive with hCG when their ability to stimulate testosterone synthesis was analyzed. Nevertheless, the glycosidase-treated derivatives were potent inhibitors of hCG-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, suggesting that removal of the sugars did not influence binding of the hormone to the cell as much as it reduced the ability of the bound hormone to activate adenyl cyclase. This hypothesis was further supported by our finding that the hCG derivatives were highly effective inhibitors of 125I-hGC binding to the intact cells. Removal of sialic acid and galactose enhanced the inhibition, whereas removal of all the sugar residues only decreased the inhibition slightly. The degree of these effects was comparatively small. The possibility that steroidogenesis and cyclic AMP accumulation are altered independently by hCG stimulation is discussed.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The activity of cytochrome oxidase (an inner mitochondrial membrane marker) in mouse mammary gland homogenates was found to increase five- to sixfold from late pregnancy to day 8 of lactation, while that of monoamine oxidase (an outer membrane marker) increased only about 25%. The specific activity of cytochrome oxidase in the isolated mitochondria decreased slightly over the same period while the specific activity of monoamine oxidase decreased fivefold. This reflects the fact that both cytochrome oxidase and mitochondrial protein are increasing at a much greater rate than is monoamine oxidase activity. Mixing experiments preclude the possibility that the release or removal of an inhibitor or stimulator produces the changes in enzymatic activity. The cytochrome oxidase to monoamine oxidase ratio was followed throughout the pregnancy-lactation cycle in total mammary homogenates, isolated mammary parenchymal cells, and isolated mammary mitochondria. In each preparation the pattern was the same with little change in the ratio until late pregnancy; and then a three- to fourfold increase occurred and the values reached a maximum by day 8 of lactation. These experiments were interpreted as demonstrating that the observed enzymatic changes are reflective of alterations in the mitochondria of the mammary parenchymal cell population. Electron micrographs of mid-pregnant and mid-lactating mammary parenchymal cells in situ were prepared, and distinct changes in the mitochondrial morphology noted. The most significant and obvious change is the large increase in the number of inner membrane cristae and an increase in matrix density in the lactating gland cell. Therefore, both enzymatic and morphological studies support the concept of an expansion of the mitochondrial inner membrane during presecretory differentiation in the mouse mammary parenchymal cell.',\n",

We have now investigated the effect of E administration on serum SM activity and on plasma GH and prolactin (PRL) in 6 adult male subjects without pituitary pathology. Chronic E administration (ethinyl estradiol 0.5 mg/day for 7 to 70 days) reduced serum SM activity by 40 to 62% in each of 4 subjects (P less than 0.02 to less than 0.001). In 3 of the subjects, basal GH levels increased by 75 to 300% (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001) and basal PRL levels increased by 90 to 200% (P less than 0.01 to less than 0.001). While iv administration of normal saline did not significantly affect either SM or GH, iv administration of E (bolus injection of 25 mg conjugated estrogens, USP) to 5 subjects resulted in: a) a 46 to 80% decrease in serum SM activity in all subjects, proceeding with an apparent half-life of 2 hours, becoming significant (P less than 0.05) at 2 hours (1 subject) to 3 hours (4 subjects), maximal at 6 hours, and persisting for 12 to 24 hours; b) GH elevation to 3 to 16 times baseline level (P less than 0.01) at 2 to 3 hours in 4 subjects; and c) no significant change of PRL levels in any subject. The mean GH response to iv E was maximal at a time (2 hours) when the mean SM activity had decreased only 20% and subsided well before the nadir of SM activity. The one patient without GH response to chronic or acute E administration may have been affected by absorption of triamcinolone being applied topically during the study. These results demonstrate that in males with normal pituitary function, E reduces serum SM activity, enhances basal GH and PRL secretion, and, upon iv injection, stimulates acute GH release. Although opposite chronic E effects upon GH and SM activity support a putative negative SM-GH feed-back mechanism, iv E administration apparently provokes acute GH release by a different mechanism. The half-life of serum SM activity in the human is probably much shorter than previously estimated.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"The first objective measurements of man's ability to obtain adequate sleep during prolonged space flight were made during the three manned Skylab missions. EEG, EOG, and head-motion signals were acquired during sleep by use of an elastic recording cap containing sponge electrodes and an attached miniature preamplifier/accelerometer unit. A control-panel assembly, mounted in the sleep compartment, tested electrodes, preserved analog signals, and automatically analyzed data in real time (providing a telementered indication of sleep stage). One subject was studied during each manned mission and, while there was considerable variation among individuals, several characteristics were common to all three: stage 3 sleep increased during the flight and decreased in the postflight period; stage 4 was consistently decreased postflight, although this stage was variable during the flight; stage REM (rapid eye movement) was elevated, and REM latency decreased in the late postflight period (after day 3 postrecovery); and the number of awakenings during sleep either showed no change or decreased during the flight. In only the 28-d mission (Skylab 2) was there a significant decrease in total sleep time; in that case it was a result of voluntarily reduced rest time and was not due to difficulty in sleeping nor frequent awakening. The subject on the 84-d mission (Skylab 4) experienced more difficulty in the first half of the flight, showing a decreased total sleep time and increased sleep latency, but this resolved itself with time. Sleep latency presented no problem in the other flights. While many of the findings are statistically significant, in no case would they be expected to produce a noticeable decrement of performance capability. These findings suggest that men are able to obtain adequate sleep in regularly scheduled 8-h rest periods during extended space flights. It seems likely, based upon these results, that the problems encountered in earlier space flights did not arise from the zero-g environment per se but possibly were a result of more restricted living and working areas in the pre-Skylab spacecraft.\",\n",

The relative risk increased with follow-up duration, progressing to 2.0 after 15 years (13/6.6, P = 0.01). The excess risk after 10 years was not due simply to prolonged estrogen use, since there was no clear dose-response relation to accumulated years of use. However, higher risk accrued to women using higher-dose tablets and those taking the medication on an other than daily basis. In addition, after 10 years of follow-up observation, two factors related to low risk of breast cancer, multiparity and oophorectomy, were no longer so related.

       " {'abstract': \"Only recently have a sufficient number of publications been available to legitimize a review of the pharmacology of the mammalian pineal organ. Two decades ago Kitay & Altschule reviewed the world literature on pineal physiology, which comprises several thousand papers, and concluded only that removal of the pineal, or administration of pineal extracts, somehow affected pigmentation in lower vertebrates and gonadal function in mammals (1). As the studies described below demonstrate, much more information is now available concerning the pharmacology of the pineal. This review subdivides present knowledge into two areas: (a) the effects on mammals of administering pineal extracts or pure synthetic or natural pineal constituents and (b) the effects of drugs and hormones on the pineal itself. As might be anticipated, the bulk of studies cited in both categories deals with the pineal hormone, melatonin. Melatonin was first isolated from bovine pineal extracts in 1958 by Lerner and his colleagues (2), who used as a marker the capacity of the hormone to aggregate the pigment granules in amphibian melanophores around the cell nucleus. Five years later, Wurtman et al (3) showed that melatonin affected a physiological function in mammals, that is, the size and secretion of the ovary, and subsequent studies have demonstrated that melatonin administration also modifies the growth, composition, and functional activities of numerous other organs. Only recently an assay was developed that allows quantification of the melatonin in human urine (4). The concentrations of the compound vary with a characteristic daily rhythm, peaking at night. The pineal's apparent role as the sole or major source of melatonin, the presence of melatonin in urine, and the demonstration that physiologic effects follow a pinealectomy or the administration of melatomin seem to justify labeling it a pineal hormone. Melatonin synthesis and pineal biosynthetic activity are generally controlled by the sympathetic nerves of this organ (5,6). Therefore, it should not be surprising that drugs known to modify the synthesis, release, or metabolism of norepinephrine in peripheral organs also affect pineal function. Melatonin is itself a derivative of another biogenic amine, serotonin, whose metabolism and actions are also affected by numerous drugs. Indeed, the pineal has often provided an apt tool for examining monoaminergic mechanisms for pharmacologists not specifically concerned with its particular functional properties.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The effects of copper ions on the binding of steroids to receptors revealed that the inhibitory effect of Cu++ was apparent at 10(-6)M, ANd the binding capacities decreased to 10% at 10(-2)M Cu++. The kinetic study demonstrated that Cu++ was a competitive inhibitor of steroid hormone-receptor binding (Ki divided by 2.7 X 10(-5)M to estrogen receptor; Ki divided by 5.1 X 10(-6)M to progesterone receptor). These results indicate that copper ions interfere at the steroid-binding site of receptor and that progesterone receptor is more affected by copper ions than is estrogen receptor. The sedimentation pattern showed the dissociation and aggregation of receptor macromolecules by copper. These phenomena may indicate the biologic inactivation of receptor. In fact, morphologically, progestational proliferation was severely inhibited and estrogenic action seemed to be inhibited. The Timm stain showed copper uptake by endometrial epithelium and superficial stromata. The copper content apparently increased in the cytoplasm of uteri bearing a copper intrauterine device, compared with controls. In vivo, the concentration of cytoplasmic copper was approximately 1.4 X 10(-6)M, which was obviously inhibitory to steroid hormone-receptor interaction. However, complete morphologic suppression of the progestational effect by copper cannot exclude the coexistence of some other mechanism in these phenomena.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Line 1, a chemically induced guinea pig hepatoma, is susceptible to killing by anti-Forssman immunoglobulin M antibody and guinea pig complement. When these tumor cells are pretreated at 37 degrees with 10(-4) to 10(-11) M concentrations of the polypeptide hormone insulin, with the catecholamine L-epinephrine-HCl, or with the glucocorticoid steroids hydrocortisone sodium succinate or prednisolone sodium succinate, the cells show a marked reduction in their suseptibility to killing by antibody and guinea pig complement; pretreatment at 0 degrees is ineffective. Similar results were obtained with another antigenically distinct guinea pig hepatoma (line 10) when tested with anti-Forssman immuno-globulin M or specific antitumor antibodies and human complement. The ability of the hormones to render the cells resistant is dependent on time, temperature, and hormone concentration. The effect of hormone treatment is maximal between 30 and 60 min and is reversible within 4 hr even in the continued presence of hormone. Treatment of line 1 cells with up to 10,000-fold greater concentrations of the less biologically active or inactive analogs, DL-epinephrine, beta-estradiol, testosterone, or proinsulin has no effect on the susceptibility of the cells to killing by antibody and guinea pig complement. The effect of hormone treatment is not due to a direct inactivation of bound or fluid-phase complement components by the hormones or to a decrease in the ability of the cells to bind complement-fixing antibody.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Despite the accumulation of a number of studies, the mechanism of action of ACTH remains to be clarified. Although it is now clear that cyclic AMP acts as a intracellular mediator of ACTH action, the mechanism of its action on the stimulation of steroidogenesis is not known. The present studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that cyclic AMP might act directly on adrenal mitochondrial fraction to stimulate the metabolism of cholesterol to pregnenolone and progesterone, and to determine whether Ca++ might modulate the action of cyclic AMP. Adrenal mitochondria were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with dexamethasone. Steroidogenesis by the mitochondrial fraction from cholesterol-4-14C (0.2-0.25 muCi, 3.6-4.5 mmumole/sample) were measured in a system containing 20 mM tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 11.5 mM NaCl, 15.4 mM KCl, 70 mM sucrose, 10 mM sodium succinate and mitochondrial fraction (0.16-0.22 mg protein/sample). Incubations were performed at 37 degrees C, with shaking, in the presence or absence of cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and cycloheximide. After incubation, the medium was extracted with chloroform, and the extracts were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. And the radioactivity of the separated steroids was measured. The products from cholesterol-4-14C were mainly pregnenolone and progesterone, and the other products were almost negligible. Cyclic AMP effected the formation of pregnenolone and progesterone by mitochondria. Cyclic AMP exerted its effect even at low concentrations (5 X 10(-6) approximately 5 X 10(-5)M), which was presumably near the intracellular level. On the other hand, cyclic GMP (5 X 10(-5) M) failed to enhance steroidogenesis. The effect of Ca++ on the action of various concentrations (5 X 10(-6) approximately 3 X 10(-3) M) of cyclic AMP was also clearly demonstrated. Addition of Ca++ (1 mM) to the incubation medium intensified the stimulatory effect of cyclic AMP in each concentration. And in the presence of Ca++, the most effective level of cyclic AMP was shifted from 5 X 10(-4) approximately 3 X 10(-3)M to the lower concentration (5 X 10(-5)M). In addition, cyclic AMP action was modified by the changes in the concentration of Ca++ in the medium. At concentration of 10(-6) M of Ca++, steroid formation of mitochondria was maximally activated by cyclic AMP. These observations suggest that cyclic AMP enhances steroidogenesis by acting directly on adrenal mitochondria to stimulate pregnenolone and progesterone formation from cholesterol, and that Ca++ plays a significant role in its action.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The effect of estrogen on the synthesis of plasma very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the cockerel was studied both in vivo and in vitro. Synthesis was studied by immunoprecipitation techniques with antisera prepared against VLDL and a major VLDL protein. VLDL were isolated from the plasma of white Leghorn hens and estrogen-treated white Leghorn cockerels by ultracentrifugal flotation at d 1.006 g/ml. After delipidation, the lipid-free proteins (apoproteins) were fractionated on Sephadex G-150 and DEAE-cellulose. Both the hen and the estrogen-treated cockerel VLDL were shown to contain an identical apoprotein with a mol wt of approximately 12,000; the apoprotein is designated fraction B. Reduction and S-carboxy-methylation of fraction B resulted in a reduction of the molecular weight by approximately one-half, indicating a dimer-monomer relationship. Antiserum prepared to the hen VLDL dimer protein gave precipitin lines of complete identity to both the hen and cockerel dimer, monomer, VLDL, apoVLDL, low density lipoproteins, and plasma; no precipitin line was formed with either hen or cockerel high density lipoproteins. After a single subcutaneous injection of diethylstilbestrol into the cockerel, plasma VLDL protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride increased, reaching a maximum 24--48 h after hormone administration. Liver slices from similarly treated animals were incubated in vitro in culture medium in the presence of [3H]lysine for 2 h. Immunoprecipitable radioactivity in VLDL increased within 2 h of diethylstilbestrol treatment and reached a maximum at 24 h; VLDL radioactivity returned to base-line levels by 72 h. At the peak of induction, newly synthesized VLDL represented 11% of the total soluble protein synthesized. When actinomycin-D (5 mg/kg) was administered simultaneously with estrogen, the induction of VLDL synthesis was totally inhibited. To determine whether the effect of estrogen on VLDL synthesis was mediated at the level of transcription, partially-purified cockerel liver mRNA was prepared from estrogen-treated animals and the mRNA activity for fraction B was quantitated in a wheat germ translation system. Fraction B mRNA was found to increase from a low base-line value to a maximum 16-24 h after estrogen treatment, returning towards baseline values at 30 h. At the peak of induction, fraction B constituted 12% of the total protein synthesized. The kinetics of induction of fraction B mRNA activity in the cell-free translation system is very similar to that observed in liver slice experiments. This finding suggests that estrogen stimulates VLDL synthesis, at least partially, by enhancing the accumulation of the mRNA for one of their major apoproteins.',\n",

The main applications of testosterone determination in clinical practice are reported; special stress is laid on diagnosis on male hypogonadisms and on the study of testicular function in male sexual impotence.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'By using various staining techniques, two acidophilic and three basophilic cell-types have been distinguished in the pars distalis of Trionyx sinensis. Seasonal fluctuations in their cytoplasmic granulation, cell and nuclear size have been compared with seasonal patterns of activity in the gonads, adrenals and thyroid. On the basis of the results, specific functions have been ascribed to each cell-type. Basophils 1 activity closely parallels the seasonal thyroid cycle. Basophils 2 are probably FSH-secreting gonadotropes and their activity correlates with the seasonal cycle of spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules. The functional activity of the testicular interstitial cells correlates with the secretory pattern of the basophils 3. That these are LH-secreting cells is also suggested by the epididymidal cycle, which indicates a high level of androgen secretion coincident with the rapid degranulation of these cells, at a time of no spermatogenetic activity. Adrenal activity shows no relationship with the basophils 3 cycle, and chromophobic cells may be the locus of ACTH secretion. Acidophils 2 remain stable throughout the year and are probably somatotropes, but acidophils 1 increase their activity in autumn and are likely to be lactotropes.',\n",

After 7 days of s.c. injections, specific binding (% SB) of PRL in controls and rats treated with oPRL, hGH, ACTH, hCG, estradiol (E2), or testosterone (T) was approximately 1%. Treatment with oPRL plus ACTH increased SB to 4%; adding E2 to this combination produced a further increase to 8%, whereas the addition of T decreased hepatic binding to 1%. Combination of hGH with ACTH was most effective, giving a SB of 33%, which is similar to that observed in the liver of rats bearing a GH secreting tumor (36%). These studies suggest that GH acts synergistically with PRL and/or ACTH to increase lactogenic binding sites in the male rat liver and that sex steroids have a modulating effect on this action.',\n",

In subcellular fractions of endometrial carcinoma the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) activity decreased with decreasing differentiation of the tumour. Most of the 17beta-HSD activity was located in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions of both normal and neoplastic endometrium. After treatment of patients with gestagens only the well differentiated carcinomata significantly increased in 17beta-HSD activity demonstrating that the hormonal stimulus leads to similar effects on the 17beta-HSD activity as in normal endometrium. Furthermore quantitative aspects of the in vitro binding of 3H-oestradiol and 3H-progesterone to receptor components from normal endometrium and endometrial carcinoma cytoplasmic fractions have been studied. In normal tissue the number of cytoplasmic binding sites for both oestradiol and progesterone varied dramatically during the menstrual cycle: number of oestradiol binding sites were highest during the proliferative phase and fell during the secretory phase; for progesterone site the contrary was the case. In all endometrial carcinomata high oestradiol binding activity was observed. In contrast the number of progesterone sites in the tumours was related to the state of differentiation, which paralled the progestional sensitivity of these tumours.',\n",

First of all, there is a 2,5- to 4fold increase of renin substrate synthesis in the liver. As a consequence, more angiotensin I and angiotensin II are released. Angiotensin II stimulates the secretion of aldosterone in the adrenals, thus producing a higher aldosterone concentration in plasma. The urinary excretion of aldosterone is elevated to a lesser degree, probably because of the simultaneously increased binding of aldosterone to plasma proteins. The release of renin is suppressed to 50% by negative feedback mechanisms. Some possible factors in the etiology of hypertension induced by oral contraceptives are discussed.',\n",

No significant difference was found between male and female subjects. Plasma 16 beta-OH-DHEA rose significantly (P less than 0.001) during ACTH stimulation, declined significantly (P less than 0.005) during dexamethasone suppression, declined significantly (P less than 0.05) during gonadal suppression, rose significantly (P less than 0.05) during gonadal stimulation and rose significantly (P less than 0.005) after the administration of WIN 24,540, an inhibitor of 3 beta-ol-dehydrogenase. The concentration of 16 beta-OH-DHEA in adrenal venous blood was higher than in inferior vena cava blood, but 16 beta-OH-DHEA in hepatic venous blood was not higher than 16 beta-OH-DHEA in arterial blood. It is inferred that 16 beta-OH-DHEA is secreted directly by the adrenal cortex and probably the gonads. Plasma 16 beta-OH-DHEA was elevated in normal pregnant women, pregnant women with toxemia, and in patients with Cushing's disease, ectopic ACTH-producing tumor, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but it was not elevated in patients with low-renin essential hypertension.\",\n",

When injected directly into the amniotic sac, more than 65 per cent of the injected dose remained unchanged after 1 hour, with minimal transfer into the maternal and fetal compartments. This study showed rapid bidirectional exchange of cyclic AMP between the mother and the fetus. Both of these compartments can contribute cyclic AMP to the amniotic fluid, independently or in concert.

Hormone binding to tumors was decreased by treatment with prolactin (0.5 or 1 mg/day) or estradiol valerate (7.5 mg/kg/week). In contrast, prolactin treatment did not affect prolactin binding to liver membrane particles, but estradiol valerate treatment resulted in a four-fold increase in prolactin binding to this tissue. Lergotrile mesylate, which lowers plasma prolactin levels, did not affect tumor growth or prolactin binding to either tumor or liver. Prolactin binding to both tumor and liver was significantly reduced in diabetic rats, suggesting that insulin may play an important role in controlling tissue sensitivity to prolactin. Specific binding of 125I-labeled prolactin to enzymatically dissociated cells from R3230AC tumors was demonstrated in vitro. The binding capacity of the cells was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the binding capacity in membrane preparations when appropriate corrections were applied for yields of cells and membranes. R3230AC tumor, which is responsive to prolactin appears therefore to be a useful model system for further study aimed at elucidation of growth and metabolic response to the hormone prolactin in breast cancer.',\n",

This question was studied in Olmsted County, Minnesota, by identifying all cases of endometrial cancer among residents over a 30 year period (1945 through 1974) and by matching four controls to each of the 145 patients. The rate of past exposure to any exogenous estrogen for any duration was about the same for patients as for controls. However, the estimated relative risk of endometrial cancer associated with conjugated estrogen treatment of 6 months or longer was 4.9 (P less than 0.01), and this increased to 7.9 (P less than 0.01) with exposure for 3 years or longer. The risk increased with larger doses (1.25 mg. or more) and continuous administration of conjugated estrogens. The incidence of endometrial carcinoma over the three decades of the study, corrected for an increasing rate of hysterectomy, was constant. Thus to this time, the low rate of use of conjugated estrogens in this region over the past 30 years apparently has not had an appreciable impact on the incidence of endometrial cancer.',\n",

Specific prolactin binding was confined to tumor cells, and nonspecific binding was present in alveolar spaces and connective tissue. In some tumors, all cells contained receptors; in others, up to one-half the cells remained unlabeled. These results suggested that variation in receptor content in DMBA-induced mammary tumors may be caused by two distinct populations of cells--one which contains receptors and another which possesses very few receptor sites or none at all.',\n",

Support was principally conjugated estrogen with the customary dose 1.5 mg/day. The follow-up studies in this group of women shows a marked drop in deaths from all causes over those which might have been expected. This improvement in mortality is principally the result of diminished number of deaths from heart attack and from cancer. Those causes of death which would not be expected to be related to hormonal therapy show the anticipated number of mortalities. There is also a marked improvement in the clinical evidence of osteoporosis. In this group there is an increase in the number of breast cancers over those which might have been expected, but there is a lower mortality from breast cancer than the anticipated mortality. The general impact of long-term estrogen therapy following hysterectomy is favorable over those figures for the expected incidence of cancer and heart disease.',\n",

In cases of simple mole routine chemotherapy does not seem to be justified and usually, in 9 cases out of 10, it is useless. It is certainly not always effective and sometimes it may even be dangerous because of the development of chemoresistance. Invasive mole and tumours where a histological diagnosis has not been made and where there is no particularly unfavourable prognosis, usually heal with twice weekly methotrexate carried on for two months after cure has been confirmed clinically, radiologically and biologically. Choriocarcinomata and cases where histology has not been carried out but which have poor prognosis (extra-pulmonary metastases, numerous or large pulmonary metastases, long delay in treatment and the excretion of high levels of HCG) justify chemotherapy in which vincristine is followed by methotrexate or vincristine is followed by actinomycine D.

This severe endemia affects 1.5 million inhabitants and constitutes a major public health problem. If administered to an entire population, single injections of slowly resorbable iodized oil can reduce goitre prevalence substantially, correct the iodine deficiency and restore normal thyroid function for a period of 3 to 7 years, depending on the parameter considered. The cost of programme of endemic goitre prevention based on this method can be estimated at 0.07 US dollars per person and per year of protection. A strategy of goitre and cretinism control in Central Africa, using iodized oil in an attack phase and iodized salt in a follow-up phase, is proposed.

Several enzymes providing lipid precursors (phosphofructokinase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and citrate cleavage enzyme) showed increased specific activity. These changes may represent insulin effects. Specific activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, usually associated with control of gluconeogenesis, was also increased. The latter is compatible with increased capability for glycogenesis, which is recognized as a progesterone effect.',\n",

Continuous infusion of synthetic ACTH (10 microgram/h) or dexamethasone (1mg/24 h) into the foetus, starting between days 124 and 129, induced premature parturition. The concentration of progesterone in the maternal peripheral plasma decreased before parturition in all animals while the level of oestradiol increased in ewes with intact foetuses or in those in which hypophysectomy was incomplete. When hypophysectomy was complete, no increase in the maternal level of oestradiol occurred before delivery. The concentration of 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-prostaglandin F2alpha increased in the peripheral plasma of ewes with intact or hypophysectomized foetuses infused with ACTH. It is suggested that an intact foetal pituitary gland is required for the rise in the level of oestrogen prepartum, but that this rise is not essential for increased prostaglandin production of parturition.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The failure of reproductive function in aged rats could be due to deficiencies at the level of the ovary, pituitary, hypothalamus, or higher brain centers. The classic explanation that the ovary is depleted of follicles does not receive adequate support on the basis of histologic studies of aged ovaries. Basal serum gonadotropin levels change with increasing age in female rats. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels rise while serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels fall. Likewise, the characteristic response to castration is markedly altered in aged female rats with a reduced secretion of FSH and a minimal elevation of LH. However, the pituitaires of these animals are still caapable of responding to exogenous LH-releasing hormone with a delayed LH response whose magnitude simulates that seen in younger female animals. With increasing age there is decreased pituitary and/or hypothalamic sensitivity to the feedback action of estradiol. These data are consistent with the postulation that there is an altered hypothalamic-hypophyseal function in aged rats.',\n",

In a statistic comparison of matched pairs of 130 cases of carcinoma of the endometrium with an equal number of selected control cases the following findings were elucidated: 1. Any estrogen preparations do not increase the relative risk for the development of carcinoma of the endometrium. 2. Differentiation into conjugated estrogens, estriol, oral contraceptives and various other estrogen compounds showed a similar trend. 3. Estrogen-androgen compounds and estrodiol compounds did not increase the relative risk for endometrial carcinoma. 4. The relative risk does not increase by prolonged ingestion of estrogen preparations in general and not for conjugated estrogens especially. 5. In the presence of other risk factors such as nulligravity, hypertension, obesity the relative risk for the development of carcinoma of the endometrium is significantly decreased when estrogens were taken, especially when the coincidental risk factor to estrogen ingestion was obesity. The above results suggest that the restraint in the prescription of estrogen for fear of endometrial carcinoma is not justified.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Our case-control study of the relation between estrogen use and endometrial cancer involved 451 cases and 888 controls. The overall risk of endometrial carcinoma was sixfold for estrogen users as compared with nonusers; long-term users (greater than five years) had a 15-fold risk. Excess risk was present for both diethylstilberstrol and conjugated estrogens. The risk associated with cyclic use was as great as that for continuous use. Increased risk was associated with estrogen use for all histologic grades of the tumor. The risk of advanced-stage carcinoma was fourfold for estrogen users, but rhe confidence interval was wide, and this question requires further study. Finally, this investigation contradicts the speculation that the association between this cancer and estrogen use can be explained by swifter diagnosis for estrogen users, misclassification of estrogen-related hyperplasia or treatment of early symptoms of the tumor with estrogen.',\n",

Our reanalysis of the WHO studies found the prostaglandins to be faster and more hazardour than hypertonic saline as intraamniotic abortifacients. Moreover, studies by the Center for Disease Control imply that dilatation and evacuation (D&E) may be more effective, safe, convenient, and inexpensive than prostaglandins for abortions after 12 weeks' gestation, especially in the 13- to 16-week interval. For gestations of greater than or equal to 17 weeks, the occurrence of live births in prostaglandin-induced abortions has produced serious legal and ethical problems in the United States. Until the effectiveness and safety of other prostaglandins regimen approach that of D&E, we feel that D&E should be the index of comparison against which newer methods of inducing abortion are tested.\",\n",

After a number of such cycles, megestrol acetate, norethindrone acetate, or dl-norgestrel was given concomitantly. Protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels were determined in total plasma and in ultracentrifugally separated lipoprotein fractions. Over the dosage range studied, the effects of the two kinds of estrogen were indistinguishable. Except for human total plasma triglyceride, no dose-related differences were observed. The lowering of serum protein and the increase in cholesterol induced by estrogen were more pronounced in baboons and beagles than in human subjects. The cholesterol-depressing effect of progestational compounds observed in humans was very pronounced in baboons but absent in beagles. In all three species, estrogen increased the lipoprotein fraction cholesterol, except for human low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which was decreased. Human plasma triglyceride and phospholipid increased on estrogen administration and were decreased by the progestins; in the two animal species, triglyceride is normally very low and the estrogen-induced changes were negligible; the phospholipid rose with estrogen but was unaffected by progestins. In sum, the two animal species show many similarities to, as well as important differences from, the human response of plasma lipids to various contraceptive steroids.',\n",

In two longitudinal studies covering 23 months of breast feeding, analyses of lipid components and protein were performed. The compositions remained virtually constant over 23 months of lactation except for a decrease of protein concentration during the first 6 months, a rising trend of myristic acid (14:0) and a falling trend of oleic acid (18:1). Infants were growing well on breast milk with nothing else for the first 5 months, but thereafter their growth curves were no longer satisfactory as judged by Western standards: weight for age (percentage of Harvard standards) decreased from 5 to 10 months of age to level off thereafter at a value of 80%. The mothers' weight for height remained constant. In a cross-sectional study, additional determinations were performed: aminograms, lactose, calories, iron, copper, manganese, zinc, and vitamin E. All data were compared with those of the literature. Lauric (12:0) and myristic (14:0) acids were higher, total lipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids lower than those published for Western countries. Plasma composition of the mothers showed lower levels of albumin, lipids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as blood hemoglobin. Possible correlations between various variables such as milk composition, plasma levels, and anthropometry were calculated and discussed.\",\n",

Vasomotor disturbances were absent in 42 of these patients (group 1) and present in 40 (group 2). Headaches, insomnia, and dyspareunia were the most common complaints among the women with vasomotor symptoms, whereas loss of libido and depression predominated in those without. Conjugated equine oestrogens (Premarin) 1.25 mg daily given for three weeks out of four relieved nearly all symptoms in group 2, but in group 1 the response was disappointing. The mean plasma oestradiol concentration in women with vasomotor symptoms was significantly lower than that observed during days 1-10 of the menstrual cycle, but plasma testosterone values were not significantly different from those observed in younger women. Plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone  (LH) concentrations were similar to those seen after the menopause. Concentrations of these hormones in the women without vasomotor symptoms were similar to those in the younger, regularly menstruating women. After six months of oestrogen treatment patients in group 2 had a 2.1-fold increase in mean plasma oestradiol concentration, and plasma FSH and LH concentrations were reduced to 39% and 66% of their pretreatment values respectively; in group 1, however, no such pronounced changes occurred. High concentrations of FSH were present in patients with oestrogen-responsive symptoms, 15 U/1 being the diagnostic cut-off point. This measurement in the presence of characteristic symptoms therefore constitutes the best method of selecting patients for oestrogen-replacement therapy.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'It has long been recognized that patients with clinical coronary heart disease (CHD) have, on average, higher concentrations of plasma very low density and low density lipoproteins than do healthy subjects. The same studies clearly demonstrated that coronary victims tend also to have low plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL). It is only recently, however, that the possible significance of this second observation has been examined. Direct evidence for an inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol concentration and the prevalence of clinical CHD, independent of other plasma lipoproteins, has been provided by the Honolulu Heart and Cooperative Lipoprotein Phenotyping Studies. The Tromsø Heart and Framingham Studies subsequently demonstrated that this relationship precedes the clinical manifestation of coronary disease. More recently, angiographic studies have confirmed that the severity of existing coronary atherosclerosis is inversely related to HDL cholesterol concentration. Other investigations have shown that coronary victims also have low mean concentrations of apolipoproteins AI and AII (the major protein components of HDL), although the reduction of apoAI concentration may be less marked that that of HDL cholesterol, and preliminary findings from Tromsø have suggested that apolipoprotein AI may be less powerful that HDL cholesterol as a predictor of CHD. Such observations have supported the porposal that HDL may exert a protective effect against coronary atherosclerosis. Final comfirmation (or otherwise) of this hypothesis, however, must await the results of carefully controlled animal experiments and of regression studies in patients with angiogrphically defined atherosclerosis.',\n",

The results obtained showed that there was a significant inhibition of ACTH secretion during long-term treatment with antiovulatory compounds or estrogens, and in half of the cases, there was a delay in normalization of the pituitary-adrenal axis following interruption of the drug, supporting a state of transitory hypoadrenalism.',\n",

Interviews with 79 women with HCA and with 220 age- and neighborhood-matched controls were completed. Limited information was obtained on nine additional patients who had died. Women with HCA and hemorrhage have a greater risk of morbidity and death than those with other symptoms. Increasing duration of OC use increases the risk of HCA. Use of OCs with high hormonal potency and age over 30 years may further increase a woman's risk of HCA. Long-term users of OCs have an estimated annual incidence of HCA of 3 to 4 per 100,000.\",\n",

The sample population consisted of 84 pairs of randomly chosen postmenopausal in-patients, matched for age and diagnosis. The treatment group received high-dose conjugated estrogens, cyclically with progesterone. The controls recieved placebos. Results revealed no statistically significant difference in that incidence of thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction (MI), or uterine cancer. There was a lower incidence of breast cancer in the treated group. Estrogen-treated patients showed a higher incidence of cholelithiasis. Those in the treated group who began the study with elevated beta/alpha lipoprotein ratios showed a reduction in that ratio over the course of the study, while the controls either maintained or increased their ratios. The low number of cases precludes drawing any real significance from the data on diseases of low frequency. The study excludes only a high incidence of complications from estrogens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The relation of the hypothalamic-pituitary effect on gonadotrophin secretion and the concentration of serum hCG after molar abortion was investigated. Gonadotrophin release after a bolus injection of LH-RH or conjugated oestrogens was observed in 17 women until 5 months after molar abortion. Little if any response of gonadotrophin was observed at a hCG level of 100 mIU/ml or more, but the response of LH and FSH to LH-RH were restored to normal when the serum hCG level decreased to below 100 mIU/ml. A normal response of LH to conjugated oestrogens was observed at a serum hCG level of 20 mIU/ml or less. These findings suggest that a high level of hCG interferes with pituitary gonadotrophin secretion, that the threshold hCG levels for normal responses of gonadotrophins to LH-RH and oestrogen are 100 and 20 mIU/ml, respectively, and that secretion of gonadotrophins is restored even in the presence of a low hCG level.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'A retrospective study was made of 74 women who had received estrogen continuously, cycled with progesterone, for menopausal symptoms over an average 57-month period. Treated patients were compared with control patients from the same private practice. Vabra endometrial aspiration biopsies showed no statistical differences between 25 treated and 28 untreated patients in the frequency of normal, inactive, hyperplastic or neoplastic specimens. The most common finding in the treated group was a secretory response, which suggests that progesterone exerts an antiestrogen effect even when estrogen is given on a continuing basis. There is evidence that the vaginal maturation index in the postmenopausal patient, although helpful in determining the current state of her systemic estrogen activity, may not reflect the effect of estrogen on the endometrium. Estrogen therapy has no absolute predictable correlation with endometrial histology. Thus, the information from routine endometrial curettage is essential to evaluate the status of all treated patients. Among all hormone-treated patients (74), weight decreased over time, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels were relatively unchanged, and Papanicolaou smear classes improved.',\n",

Nineteen of the tumors were malignant and, to date, 12 of those patients have died of their disease.

       " {'abstract': 'All hormones act only on their target tissues. The ability of a tissue to react to a hormone is due to the presence of a receptor in or at the cell. There are two classes of hormone receptors: those bound to the membrane and those present in the cytosol. Peptide hormones generally act through membrane receptors. The interaction of a hormone with its receptors leads to an activation of the adenylate cyclase and the production of cyclo-AMP, the second messenger. In cases where several hormones act on the same tissue (example: adipose tissue) they must interact with their specific receptors, but presumably with the same adenylate cyclase. This interaction is discussed. The receptors for steroid hormones are not membrane-bound, but present in the cytosol. They are specific proteins which bind the hormone rather tightly. This results in a change in protein conformation, sometimes accompanied by a dimerization; the modified receptor is then transferred to the cell nucleus where it stimulates transcription. The control mechanisms of transcription are discussed; the most probable mode of action is removal of a repressor or repressor-like component from chromatin which results in deinhibition of transcription. mRNA is then produced and translated into protein. Post-transcriptional controls have been postulated, but never unequivocally demonstrated.',\n",

The concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and HDL-phospholipids were determined after one, three and six months and compared to the mean of two determinations of the same parameters before medication. Triglycerides increased by 18--42 per cent after 1--6 months of treatment with 50/125. The HDL-cholesterol and HDL-phospholipids were reduced by 10 per cent during 50/250 treatment. No other parameters showed any consistent alteration in any of the treatment groups. Raised triglyceride concentration and/or decreased HDL concentration increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. It is therefore suggested that in order not to alter the HDL concentration a combined oral contraceptive agent should not contain more gestagen-androgen than corresponding to 125--150 micrograms of levonorgestrel. To avoid a rise of the triglyceride level the weight relation between levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol should be about 5:1.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'In relation to the total number of births in the United Kingdom there was an excess of hydatidiform moles arising in women over 34 years of age and possibly also under 15. The incidence of trophoblastic tumour requiring chemotherapy after hydatidiform mole was greatest in the 30 to 34 years age group and it was also high in the 20 to 24 years age group. This distribution appears to be influenced by the morphology of the moles, the mode of their removal and the use of oestrogens and progestogens in the post-evacuation period. The need for chemotherapy for trophoblastic tumour after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole was found to be two- to three-fold greater in patients who had undergone a medical induction, hysterectomy or hysterotomy compared with those whose hydatidiform moles had been evacuated by vacuum or surgical curettage, or who had aborted spontaneously. The increased risk of chemotherapy was most marked in the earlier weeks of gestation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The mitogenic action of the estrogen-receptor complex is supposedly similar in both normal and malignant target tissues. As receptors are present in several types of non-target tissues, in the case of lesions at the nuclear acceptor sites, the complex in those might be able to cause successive mitoses. Estrogen-dependent tumors of non-target tissues have been reported by several investigators. In normal and malignant cells of the breast and some other types of non-endocrine cells, the ability to produce their own estrogens (from circulating precursors) has been shown. The locally formed estrogens might have a role in the initiation of some malignant transformations. Indications of this process are the switching to estrogen production of some neoplastic endocrine or undifferentiated cells, certain ectopic effects displayed by some cancerous tissues, and the possible roles of GH, PRL and cholesterol in the development of some malignancies. The present endocrine system for the synthesis of the sexual hormones might be a specialization of a system at the cellular level. Polypeptide hormones might evolve from regulatory parts of cyclases or phosphodiesterases. Traces of the original biological processes might still be maintained by several cell-types.',\n",

In Study B, biochemical data were collected from eight women before and during the first three or four months therapy with preparations containing 30 microgram of ethinyl oestradiol and 150 microgram of D-norgestrel. The two oral contraceptive dosage forms studied produced qualitatively and quantitatively similar metabolic changes. Both caused an increase in serum concentration of triglycerides (30% to 33%), beta-lipoproteins (27% to 29%) and ceruloplasmin (75% to 90%), and a decrease in serum levels of antithrombin III (22% to 29%) and ascorbic acid (30% to 42%). Serum cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations were unchanged. However, the proportion of serum cholesterol carried by alpha-lipoproteins (high density lipoproteins) decreased, while that carried by beta-lipoproteins (low density and very low density lipoproteins) increased. The former change is in the same direction, but much smaller than that observed in coronary heart disease.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'A synthesis has been attempted to explain the metabolic action of oestrogen-progestogens: and their action on carbohydrates, triglycerides, cholesterol, lipoproteins and coagulation has been reviewed. Carbohydrate tolerance can evolve in different ways, depending on the case. On the one hand hyperglycaemia, which is provoked by taking carbohydrates by mouth in a primitively pathological way, can be improved while on the other hand there can be diminution in carbohydrate tolerance in other cases. Two factors, however, remain constant, hyperinsulinism and resistance to insulin. There is no way of predicting how carbohydrate tolerance will behave. That is why pills that contain oestrogens and progestogens, even if they are \"mini-dose\" pills, are contra-indicated for women who have pancreatic diabetes. Pills with a high oestrogen content raise the triglycerides, while those which have a higher progestogen content tend to raise the blood cholesterol levels. High-density lipoprotein tends to be raised with an oestrogenic milieu and lowered with progestogens or with pills that have a strong progestogen content.',\n",

The diagnosis was made by biopsy under laparoscopic control. Twenty one cases have already been reported in the literature. The aetiological role of contraceptives in the development of generally benign (approximately 200 published cases) and sometime malignant hepatic lesions, has not been definitely proven. The regression of certain benign tumours when contraceptives are stopped is the essential argument. In some patients, the association of benign lesions and of hepatic carcinoma suggests a single pathogenesis. The early recognition of such lesions justifies their being sought routinely in patients taking oral contraceptives (palpation of the liver, questioning concerning pain in the hepatic region). A national register will be required in order to determine their exact prevalence.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Seminal plasma free intact human washed spermatozoa have hydrolytic activity on N-benzoil-D-L-arginine-naftilamide (BANA). Kinetic activities of this enzymatic activity are similar to those described for acrosine. Therefore, it is likely that it would be the same enzyme. BANA- hydrolytic activity might be liberated to the medium by incubation of pH lower than 4.0 and reincorporates to the membrane after adjustment of the medium to alkaline pH. pH- dependant enzyme liberation curve is similar to titration curve of sialic acid attached to the membrane. Attachment of the enzyme to the spermatic membrane diminishes its specific activity. However, if spermatozoa are previously treated with neuraminidase, its membrane afinity is inhibited. It is thought that this enzyme in the spermatozoon is present as protein ionically bound to the membrane and that sialic acid participates in this union. It is postulated that drastic treatments such as the use of ultrasound or detergents produce redistribution of specific proteins.',\n",

The closure of the internal urethral orifice was induced by the electric stimulation of the lateral fibers of the lower mesenteric plexus. The closing state of the orifice was measured with a latex balloon inserted into the orifice. The autonomic drugs were given into the aorta just above its bifurcation. From the results obtained in this study it was concluded that the closure of the internal urethral orifice during ejaculation is predominantly under the influence of the adrenergic nervous system, particularly through an alpha-adrenergic receptor mechanism.',\n",

In addition, when associations between their mean depression scores and other variables such as planned pregnancy, preferred infant sex, identified obstetrical problems, help at home, experiencing the baby blues, and an identified recent sad life event were calculated, no significant differences were noted.

Record reviews completed at the conclusion of each semester from December 1973 to December 1976 showed a statistically significant increase in diaphragm acceptors. In the fall semester of 1976, diaphragm acceptors (49% of 151 patients) surpassed pill acceptors (46%). Data from 123 questionnaires revealed that concern for pill and IUD side effects was the primary reason for diaphragm choice. The study numbers are small, but a definite trend is evident. These educated young women may be forerunners, and an increase in diagphragm use in the general population may be seen in the near future.',\n",

Whether the physician is innocent or guilty of malpractice quickly becomes a side issue when it is discovered that he has tampered with the evidence, thereby attempting to perpetrate a fraud upon the court. And discovered it will be--the techniques are sophisticated and the motivation is high. Medical records are also important in workman's compensation cases, insurance claims, personal injury cases, and even in physician disciplinary hearings as well as their collection of bills. In creating and maintaining patient records, physicians and hospitals have several legal duties, including the duty to do so adequately, to safeguard the records' physical existence, and to prevent such use of the records as would violate the patient's right to confidentiality. Courts and legislatures are looking with increasing favor on the patient's interest in the content of his record, a phenomenon which is closely linked to the nationwide trend in favor of the patient's right to know and his right to determine his own physical destiny. For all these reasons, medical records no longer serve exclusively as the physician's private aid; medical records are increasingly becoming legal documents as well.\",\n",

Immunoreactive hormone was not detected in samples obtained from men, and only rarely in plasma of nonpregnant women. Immunoreactive relaxin was present as early as the fourth week of pregnancy and was detectable throughout the course of gestation. Immunoreactive relaxin tended to be higher early in pregnancy, and there was no peak just before parturition as occurs in many other species. Our results are at variance with those of Bryant and coworkers, who reported high levels of immunoreactive relaxin in men and nonpregnant as well as pregnant women. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are presented.\",\n",

As requirements expand, these regulations have assumed considerable importance for psychiatric research, including research interviews. The author's experience with one committee on research involving human beings provided the impetus for the present report. Subjects were drawn from a prospective study of couples in a home dialysis program. Thirty couples were systematically interviewed concerning social, personal, medical, and psychiatric history. After completion of the interview, subjects were asked a series of questions concerning their feelings about being interviewed. Although most subjects found the experience to be pleasant, nearly half believed it might upset other patients. However, none believed any long-term harm could come from the conduct of the interview itself. It is therefore concluded that the potential harm of structured interviews in severely medically ill patients and their spouses is essentially nil.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Epidural analgesia (bupivacaine) was administered during labor after amniotomy, in some cases supplemented by intravenous oxytocin. A higher incidence of transient uterine hypertonus was seen after blocking. Fetal heart rate changes mainly took the form of bradycardia (in association with uterine hypertonus). At birth, the maternal biochemical condition was characterized by a lower degree of metabolic acidosis, compared to normal unanesthetized controls. The fetuses displayed a slight degree of hypoxia and hypercapnia. The mechanisms underlying these modifications are discussed. Epidural blockade in combination with elective induction of labor, whether or not supplemented by intravenous oxytocin, may carry a risk. Its magnitude is considered acceptable for both mother and fetus provided they are constantly under close surveillance, limited amounts of bupivacaine are administered and the second stage of labor is kept short. However, some warnings against epidural analgesia apply to patients with placental insufficiency and very active labor.',\n",

Of these, 79 women had taken combined estrogen-progestogen preparations, 9 women had taken progestogens alone, while 14 patients formed a control group. There was a significant difference only between the control group without hormones and the groups treated with hormones. The groups of patients under the various regimens of hormonal treatment displayed a varying percentage of cribriform adenomatous hyperplasia. There was a clear tendency for such lesions to be observed more frequently under the combined type of contraception than under the sequential type. These differences were not, however, significant. A correlation with specific exogenous groups of steroids could not be established.',\n",

In the proliferative endometrium the concentration of estrogen binding sites was significantly higher than that of progesterone receptor while, in the secretive endometrium, the concentration of estrogen receptor was low, compared to that of progesterone receptor. The highest concentration of both receptors was observed during the periovulatory period. From the correlation observed between estrogen and progesterone receptors and the levels of the respective steroids in the plasma, it is suggested that the levels of plasma estradiol or its own tissue receptor determine the synthesis of progesterone receptors in the periovulatory period.',\n",

Following six of seven months' use of the progesterone-releasing device a significant decrease in the mean DNA-content per cell nucleus was found in the epithelial cells indicating a suppression of the proliferative activity of the endometrium. The mean DNA-values of the endometrial cells remained at a low level throughout the cycles in spite of circulating levels of steroids indicating a normal ovarian function. It is suggested that the progesterone released in utero interferes with the DNA-synthesis of the epithelial cells, which may result in a disturbed metabolic function of the endometrium at the time of implantation.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Research in human subjects should be conducted only if the rights and welfare of the participants are protected. Prospective study subjects must be given adequate information about all aspects of a study so that they can make a rationally exercised decision about participation; coercive techniques to solicit participants should not be used. Research in humans may be classified in one of three categories: (1) research on treatment of existing conditions; (2) research on preventive measures; and (3) research other than for treatment or prevention. Different concerns and aspects of informed consent assume particular importance in each category. In research on the treatment of existing conditions, untreated or placebo-treated control groups are rarely justified if the condition is irreversible. In research on preventive methods prospective subjects should be informed of the likelihood of receiving an ineffective treatment, if one or more placebo groups are included. A randomized clinical trial is usually the best design for studies of preventive methods. Non-randomized designs, which are feasible and statistically valid, may be employed in order to avoid depriving some subjects from receiving effective preventive methods. In social or behavioral research, confidentiality of collected information and privacy of the subject are essential considerations.',\n",

It is concluded that the risks involved to subjects are minimal in this field of research. The use of deception in psychological research is discussed along with the necessity of appropriately debriefing the subject. The use of institutional committees to protect subjects' rights is contrasted with the bureaucratic review processes of the government. It is concluded that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the local institutional review process is likely to induce greater cooperation from investigators in protecting subjects' rights.\",\n",

The response in all subjects was good; the subjective symptoms decreased, the liver function tests showed a tendency towards normal values. Furthermore, the levels of serum antibodies declined and the hepatic metabolic ability, as tested by serum albumin levels and indices of drug metabolism, improved. The beneficial influence of progesterone on the patients may be due to the immunosuppressive effect and enhancement of protein synthesis. The results suggest that medroxyprogesterone may be a valuable alternative for patients with autoimmune liver disease, particularly in cases developing resistance or undesirable reactions to the previous therapy.',\n",

That nearly half of the children had been conceived within cohabiting situations. 2. That nearly one in five ex-nuptial children was the result of a planned pregnancy. 3. Maternal reactions to the birth and pregnancy varied with the mother's situation: cohabiting mothers reported considerably less adverse reaction to the birth than did non-cohabiting mothers. 4. Overall, mothers of ex-nuptial children had a fairly sophisticated appreciation of contraceptive methods. 5. One quarter of unplanned ex-nuptial pregnancies were the result of contraceptive failure and three-quarters were the result of contraceptive non-usage. 6. In common with previous findings for nuptial pregnancies, about 35 percent of unplanned ex-nuptial pregnancies were ascribed to a breakdown in the mother's pattern of usage of the contraceptive pill.\",\n",

The serum prolactin level in fully breast-feeding women was significantly higher than in women who were partially breast-feeding. The mean basal serum prolactin level in menstruating, lactating women was significantly higher than the mean level in women who had weaned and had normal menstrual cycles. The rise in prolactin due to suckling was seen up to 66 weeks postpartum. The marked variability and lack of reproducibility of individual suckling responses may obscure the importance of prolactin secretion in the postpartum period. Nevertheless, this study confirms that prolactin secretion is increased in women with prolonged lactational amenorrhoea.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The continuation contraceptive practise of 3,293 I.U.D., 1985 pill and 749 depo-provera acceptors was analysed by a survey of family planning records. The proportions of grand multiporae were 40.3%, 24.2% and 40.4% in the three groups. Pap smears were taken in from 12 to 38.5% of acceptors and the proportions of pathological smears varied from 8.9 to 13.3%. The percentages of acceptors who attended only once more were 11% (I.U.D.), 18.1% (pill) and 25.1% (d-p.), Pregnancy rates were for the I.U.D., 1.7 per Hundred Woman Years, for the 2.1 per H.W.Y. and for d-p, 0.4, per H.W.Y. Temporary interruptions of the contraceptive methods were common with the pill and d-p. In the long run the I.U.D. is superior to the other temporary methods of contraceptives. Continuation rates with the I.U.D. were 89.9% after one year and 70.9% after five years (similar rates for the pill were 55% and 16.5% and for d-p 50.5% and 10.3%). The importance of a proper pelvic examination and the need to have all methods available for any individual receiving contraceptives are emphasized in the discussion. Tubal ligations should always be considered as an alternative to the temporary methods of contraceptives in ground multiporae and others at special risk from further pregnancies.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The association of Actinomyces with IUD wearers has been widely documented and the possibility of the recognition of actinomycetes-like organisms in routine Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears has been reported. We conducted a retrospective study of IUD wearers to determine the prevalence and significance of actinomycetes-like organisms found in such smears. Three hundred smears from current IUD wearers were rescreened for actinomycetes-like organisms. Of this group, 200 patients were from a public health family planning clinic, and 100 were private patients. The incidence for the public health group was 25.5% and for the private patient group, 8%. A case history of actinomycosis is included. Findings such as other infectious agents, abnormal cytology and symptoms are also discussed. Although the presence of Actinomyces probably represents an opportunistic infection, the threat of pelvic actinomycosis with serious complications poses a management problem to the clinician when Actinomyces is reported in a routine Papanicolaou smear. Our findings lead us to question the practicality of the earlier recommendations of IUD removal and antibiotic therapy.',\n",

The goal of this investigation has been to combine, in reduced quantity, prostaglandin and hypertonic saline in order to minimize the complications and side-effects associated with the separate administration of each component. This study documents the results of a random sample of 385 abortions performed in the second trimester, induced by intra-amniotic instillation of prostaglandin (20 mg) and NaCl 5 and 10 g in different volumes and concentrations augmented with oxytocin. In a series of 20 patients, the coagulation profile is presented and the clinical characteristics of 4 groups are compared. This study demonstrated no coagulation defects. The gastrointestinal side-effects were reduced. In spite of the reduced dosage of each component, the instillation abortion interval still remained 17.08 h on the average. Incomplete abortion ranged from 32% to 48.78%. The data presented in this report suggests that combination of prostaglandin, hypertonic saline and oxytocin is feasible for midtrimester abortion.',\n",

The need is to actually define a physician's appropriate educational tasks and competencies as a basis for curriculum development in health education which would ideally be integrated into the whole educational program. This case study presents efforts to develop an educational service component at a rural health center which, connected to a major teaching hospital, serves as a learning base for medical students. Through trial and student feedback a program has been developed which includes patient counseling, evaluative home visits, group education sessions, exit interviews, medication counseling, community needs assessment and educational consultation with local school teachers. With this program as a foundation, the goal is to integrate health education learning throughout the rest of the medical curriculum.\",\n",

It consists of chronic infections in the respiratory system, male infertility, and, in about one-half of the cases, situs inversus. The syndrome thus includes Kartagener's syndrome. The syndrome provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into the role of the cilia in the human body. Five women evidently suffering from this syndrome were examined. They had no gynecologic disorders. Three of the five women had tried to become pregnant and two have suceeded. A review of the literature indicates that men with Kartagener's syndrome are usually infertile, whereas the women are not. This fact and the data presented herein constitute strong evidence that ciliary motility is not essential for female fertility. More conclusive proof could be obtained if any of the affected women would consent to ultrastructural investigation of the oviductal cilia.\",\n",

IUDs in situ provoke a non-specific inflammatory cell reaction, particularly at the glandular epithelium of the endometrium. The cellular changes include swelling of the cytoplasm and of the nuclei, the latter showing chromatin clumping, prominent nuclei and a pseudoeosinophilic reaction. Cytoplasmic changes exhibit vacuolation, incorporation of leukocytes and plasmolysis varying in degree. The local inflammation also accounts for the side effects associated with the device, such as uterine bleeding and endometritis. Cytomorphologically, the differentiation between cellular inflammation through IUDs and inflammatory metaplasia is difficult, particularly if the investigator has no information about the presence of an IUD. Intrauterine application of proteinase inhibitors can be helpful in differential diagnosis of such IUD-mediated cellular changes.',\n",

This method is recommended for countries with an extensive network of primary schools. Medical examinations in a village health survey yielded a prevalence of 4.6 per 1000 children aged 6-15 years. This method was relatively expensive but could be justified if the survey was multipurpose. A question added to the annual district census showed a prevalence of 2.2 per 1000 children, a rate still many times higher than estimates from national statistics. The inclusion of such a question in a census or other national survey entails little additional cost and with more careful questioning results should improve. Repeated surveys can be used to assess the success of poliomyelitis vaccination programmes.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Mortality among members of two medium-sized trade unions, the union of carpenters/cabinet makers and the union of bricklayers, has been studied during the period 1.1.71-31.12.75, primarily to investigate if the greater exposure to dust and organic solvents of the carpenters/cabinet makers caused any increase in the mortality from lung diseases. The study did not reveal any significant differences in mortality regarding any category of diagnoses except suicide, when the analysis was based on the main diagnosis recorded on the death certificate. However, when including underlying causes of death too, statistically significant increased death rates from larynx cancer, asthma, bronchitis and emphysema were found among the bricklayers, as compared with the carpenters/cabinet makers. No explanation can be given for these observations. They may be a result of an unequal distribution of confounding variables in the two groups, or they may reflect various grades and forms of \"Healthy Worker\" selection. This study is a cross-section study and such studies and longitudinal studies over a period of a few years of occupational mortality are very sensitive to the selection of the occupational groupings. The analysis is based on deaths among life-insured members under the age of 67 years, in the two trade unions. Copies of the death certificates were obtained from the National Health Service and then coded by us along the lines indicated by the NHS.',\n",

Among 80 women with both trichomoniasis and gonorrhea, a significantly smaller proportion used oral contraceptives as compared with a group of 253 women who had gonorrhea alone (P less than 0.002).

       " {'abstract': \"Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a polypeptide hormone originally discovered in the mouse submaxillary gland, stimulates growth in a variety of tissues in several species. This hormone has recently been identified in human urine. A homologous RIA for human EGF (RIA-hEGF) has been developed. In general, levels were similar to those recently reported using a heterologous RIA system. Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of RIA-hEGF by normal adult males and females was 63.0 +/- 3.0 and 52.0 +/- 3.5 (mean +/- SE) micrograms/total vol, or 29.7 +/- 1.1 and 39.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms/g creatinine, respectively. Excretion by females taking oral contraceptives was significantly greater (60.1 +/- 2.7 micrograms/g creatinine; P less than 0.01) than that by females who were not. Recent evidence suggests the probable identity of hEGF and beta-urogastrone, a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. Adult males with active peptic ulcer disease appeared to have lower urinary RIA-hEGF excretion (22.9 +/- 2.6 micrograms/g creatinine) than normal men, but this was not significant (P greater than 0.05). Several of those with very low values had histories of alcohol abuse. Excretion by patients with Cushing's syndrome was normal. Patients with psoriasis or recovering from major burns excreted both abnormally high and abnormally low levels of RIA-hEGF, with no obvious correlation to their clinical condition. There was no apparent diurnal or postprandial variation in urinary RIA-hEGF excretion by normal subjects. An excellent linear correlation was observed between RIA-hEGF and creatinine concentrations in each urine sample for each subject, suggesting that RIA-hEGF concentration in a random urine sample provides a valid index of 24-h RIA-hEGF excretion.\",\n",
